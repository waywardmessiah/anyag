					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] &#160; Keeping your fresh Christmas tree safe by making sure you are watering enough.&#160; A cut Christmas tree can go through a quart of water for every inch in diameter. For example, a 7-foot tree with a 3–4-inch trunk can use 3-4 quarts of water a day. That&#8217;s around a gallon! I have a whole blog post that just came out on Christmas trees and their care.
