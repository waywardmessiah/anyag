<p><strong>Home Greenhouses: A Guide to Extending Your Growing Season</strong></p>



<p>Greenhouses and cold frames are fantastic tools for any gardening enthusiast, offering opportunities to extend your growing season, start crops early, protect sensitive plants, and even grow year-round. These structures are perfect for getting your hands in the soil during colder months. For many, nurturing green, growing plants during the gray days of winter can bring a sense of hope and joy.</p>



<p>However, before you jump into owning a greenhouse, there are several important factors to consider. Thinking through these questions will help you choose the right greenhouse for your needs and ensure you’re prepared for this rewarding endeavor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Determining Your Purpose</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenline1/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg" data-orig-size="603,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GreenLine1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" width="603" height="477" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-1522" /></figure>



<p>Start by asking yourself: <strong>What’s the purpose of my greenhouse?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you want to grow year-round?</li>



<li>Are you cultivating orchids or other plants that require a temperature-controlled environment?</li>



<li>Do you need a head start on the growing season?</li>



<li>Is it part of a plan to expand your gardening operation for profit?</li>



<li>Are you look to grow fresh, off-season vegetables for your family?</li>



<li>Do you want a multi-functional structure that can serve different purposes?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re clear about how you’ll use the greenhouse, it’s time to dive deeper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Considerations</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do you have a suitable location?</strong> This is one of the most critical questions to address.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pay attention to how the sun’s position changes throughout the year, as this can affect light quality and intensity. Ensure your greenhouse gets adequate sunlight.</li>



<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> If possible, opt for an <strong>east-west orientation</strong> to distribute light evenly and maximize the winter sun. This setup is also better suited to handle prevailing winds, especially in windy regions.</li>



<li><img width="478" height="322" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3e5XMiFpB-oGcAKZcPKRvUQldjuI3IGZDDSX8IPZC5Lc1WtMK5hv5BrKxF1WvHKC321CekqeyRSjm31v5p-dpaumtuda22XUizK1bmz5c81Rk-IhP2E0CsCDXZgRDR-vFW8Pe?key=1k9zzEbJMXdDmcC7_JVjJhKn" alt="Sun Orentation1.gif"></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Before taking the plunge, take into account the following practical details:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Space:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient space and check for potential obstructions like trees and fences.</li>



<li><strong>Heating:</strong> Determine if you want a heat source you’ll use and budget for associated heating expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Consider local climate conditions, such as gray winter days, strong winds, snow fall and seasonal challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Slope and Drainage:</strong> Avoid placing your greenhouse at the bottom of a slope and ensure proper drainage to prevent water logging.  Also A greenhouse in a valley area will be colder then one that is on top of a hill. Cold air slides downhill. </li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Decide between automatic or manual ventilation to regulate temperature and humidity effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Electricity and Water:</strong> Ensure that your greenhouse has reliable access to electricity and water.</li>



<li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Plan for cooling solutions such as shade cloth, during summer months to prevent overheating.</li>



<li><strong>Zoning and Property Values:</strong> Check local ordinances for zoning regulations and consider how the greenhouse may impact neighborhood relations.</li>



<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Think about future needs—plan ahead for potential expansion as your gardening experience grows.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budget Planning</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1524" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/savings-2789137_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="savings-2789137_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1524" style="width:555px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p>When planning your project, the first question to ask yourself is, “How much am I willing to spend?” Setting a clear and realistic budget is crucial, as expenses can accumulate faster than anticipated. Beyond the initial costs, don’t overlook ongoing expenses such as electricity, water, and maintenance.  Recurring costs can significantly impact your long-term financial commitment.</p>



<p>While the allure of adding convenient features and premium upgrades may be tempting, staying within your budget ensures financial stability and prevents overspending. One smart strategy is to prioritize essential components first. Begin with a more basic setup that meets your immediate needs, and then enhance it gradually as resources allow. By pacing yourself, you’ll achieve a balance between functionality and affordability without compromising your financial goals.</p>



<p>Remember, a well-planned budget isn’t just about limiting spending—it’s about making the most of the resources you have while staying adaptable to future improvements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pests and Disease Management</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1526" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/aphid-5154237_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aphid-5154237_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1526" style="width:611px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p><strong>What’s your plan for managing pests and diseases?</strong> All greenhouses face these challenges eventually. Consider whether you’ll pursue organic methods and prepare a strategy to address these issues effectively. Learn to implement IPM.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong></h4>



<p>Integrated Pest Management combines multiple methods to create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to pest and disease control. IPM focuses on prevention, monitoring, and targeted interventions to minimize chemical use and maintain a healthy greenhouse ecosystem.</p>



<p>By implementing these strategies, you can maintain a thriving greenhouse environment and keep your plants healthy year-round. Let me know if you&#8217;d like me to expand further or focus on any specific pest or disease issue!</p>



<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in greenhouses is a strategic and environmentally conscious approach to pest control. It involves a combination of practices to manage pests effectively while minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Key components of IPM include regular monitoring of pest populations, accurate identification of pests, and the use of biological control agents such as beneficial insects or microorganisms. Cultural practices like maintaining optimal environmental conditions and sanitizing greenhouse spaces also play a vital role in preventing pest outbreaks. By integrating these methods, greenhouse growers can ensure sustainable pest management that protects crops, reduces chemical residues, and supports a healthier ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants to thrive, but they can also create a favorable setting for pests and diseases to multiply. The warm, humid conditions that benefit your plants may also attract unwanted visitors like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, or fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew and botrytis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Is Key</strong></h4>



<p>Taking proactive measures can help reduce the likelihood of outbreaks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep your greenhouse clean by removing plant debris and regularly disinfecting tools, pots, and surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Quarantine New Plants:</strong> Inspect and isolate new plants before introducing them to the greenhouse.</li>



<li><strong>Healthy Plants:</strong> Maintain proper care for plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure adequate airflow to prevent humidity from reaching levels that encourage fungal growth.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection</strong></h4>



<p>Constant vigilance is crucial for catching problems before they escalate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check plants frequently for signs of pests like holes, discoloration, sticky residue, or webbing.</li>



<li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Use yellow or blue sticky traps to monitor flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.</li>



<li><strong>Soil Checks:</strong> Periodically inspect soil for pests like fungus gnats or root-knot nematodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Control Methods</strong></h4>



<p>If issues arise, there are several ways to address them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewings, or predatory mites, to combat pests naturally.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Sprays:</strong> Use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or horticultural oils, to manage pests without harmful chemicals.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Rotate crops, avoid overcrowding, and remove infected plants promptly to limit the spread of diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> As a last resort, apply pesticides or fungicides, ensuring they are appropriate for the problem and safe for use in greenhouses. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disease-Specific Tips</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Prevent fungal issues by controlling humidity levels and avoiding overhead watering.</li>



<li><strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Avoid working with plants when they’re wet, as this can spread bacterial pathogens.</li>



<li><strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Viruses are often spread by pests like aphids. Manage pest populations to reduce the risk of viral transmission.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing Setup</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1528" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenhouse-827464_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="greenhouse-827464_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" /></figure>



<p>Think about the logistics of your greenhouse:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planting Methods:</strong> Will you grow directly in the ground, in raised beds, or on tables?</li>



<li><strong>Nutrient Delivery:</strong> How will you provide nutrients to your plants? Have a clear plan for their care and growth.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting Small</strong></h3>

<p>New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5p6DIlO6g&amp;t=1s">YouTube Video on my about cold frames</a>!!  Check it out!!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to have fresh vegetables after your garden has finished. &nbsp; It feels great to thwart the natural ending to the growing session and continue to grow vegetables for your family. Using cold frames and row covers to extend your growing season is one easy solution. The best part is, that it&#8217;s not hard to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cold Frames</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never ready for the end of the growing season.  Frost seems to come out of nowhere and kill the growing season. Cold frames are great for protecting plants from frost. Planting cold season crops in a cold frame helps with the &#8220;Growing Seasons Over&#8221; blues.  The growing seasons not over, not yet, not if you have a cold frame. &nbsp; Garden fresh vegetables in late fall early winter is amazing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z+wLj6aAL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Giantex Wood Cold Frame, Mini Garden Greenhouse, Transparent Flip Top Lid, Bottomless Planter Raised Bed for Vegetable and Flowers, Indoor and Outdoor Patio&#8230; <br><a href="https://amzn.to/410nafS">https://amzn.to/410nafS</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cold frames are also great for getting ready for the growing season.&nbsp; They warm the soil up early. This allows seed planting to happen several weeks early. Giving you a jump on the growing season. Cold frames are great at protecting young plants from late frosts in the spring. Having a few extra weeks of growth can get your garden off to a great start. &nbsp; Cold frames create a humid environment that encourages plant growth and produces bigger plants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a cold frame?</h3>



<p></p>



<p>A cold frame is essentially a box with a transparent cover.&nbsp; This box acts as a small greenhouse for your plants. They protect plants from the elements, especially frost, wind and cold temperatures.&nbsp; A micro-climate&nbsp;is created using solar energy and the ground as insulation. They are great for starting plants in the spring and growing cold tolerant plants in the fall.&nbsp; They can also be used to overwinter dormant plants. The cold frames usually stay a bit warmer throughout the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware you have made a little greenhouse, and these little greenhouses can get quite warm with good sunshine. It is not uncommon for them to get above 90-degree F.&nbsp; High temperatures can damage young seedling.&nbsp; Getting a thermometer to monitor the temperature will help avoid any unfortunate seedling death. &nbsp;Cold season plants such as cabbage, radish and lettuce need cooler temps to grow well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Venting the cold frame when it is reaching higher temperature is necessary. &nbsp; </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watering</h3>



<p> Don&#8217;t forget to water the plants in your cold frames.&nbsp; Active plant growth will use water and can quickly dry the soil out.&nbsp; You may not need as much water as you would in the summer months. It is a good idea to watch the plants and make sure they have enough water.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hardening off your Seedlings</h3>



<p>For those who don’t know, hardening off seedlings is the process of acclimatizing them to the outside temperatures. It&#8217;s hard on seedlings that have been in a warm and moist environment to adjust to the outside weather.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hardening off is important. If seedlings are shocked, it can kill them or stunt their growth.  Start by gradually exposing the seedling to the outdoors. Leave your cold frame open for longer periods. Do this repeatedly over a couple of weeks.&nbsp; You can move plants into a shaded area to help the hardening off process. Then move them back to the cold frame to help them harden off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cold frames are great for the DIY person. They are relatively simple to make and easy to use.&nbsp; Most of the time you can use materials you have on hand or can scavenge.&nbsp; Recycled materials for cold frames is a wonderful way to help the waste. &nbsp; The basic set up is a bottomless box with a piece of something&nbsp;clear to let the sun in.&nbsp; They can be as easy as placing a straw bale around your plants with a glass door on top. Alternatively, they can be a complicated woodworking project with an automatic opener and all the bells and whistles. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and Tricks to Cold Frames</h3>



<p>Insulating the box will help extend the season. Use insulation or bubble wrap or just some straw. &nbsp; This help eliminated any drafts</p>



<p>The cover doesn&#8217;t have to be totally clear. It has to let most of the light in. It can be a semitransparent film or poly carbonate.</p>



<p>Face your cold frame south.  This will capture the most sunlight. Winter sunlight can be weak but facing south makes the most of the sun that is available.&nbsp; Winter sun is on a different angle than summer sun. Utilize all the sunlight, as it is most beneficial to your plant.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bells and Whistles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can buy cold frames online if you are not a confident DIY person. They are nice option. They are quicker to get working. There is everything thing from your basic cold frame to deluxe models with nice bells and whistles.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8211; Kits have all the pieces and directions to help you build the cold frame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Kits sometimes come with automatic openers. These are great for hands-free ventilation of the cold frame. They work when it gets too warm then opens to allow the heat to escape. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Kits can have added insulation to the box will help remove drafts and help keep it warmer.</p>



<p>-Kits generally are made from a rot and disease resistant materials like plastic or treated wood to ensure a long-lasting cold frame</p>



<p>&#8211; Kits sometimes add black ground cloth to help warm the box and reduce weeds</p>



<p>-Some kits make it easy to add heat coils or seedling mats. These additions help keep it warm during colder temperatures for starting seeds.</p>



<p>-Kits are a great choice for the time crunched gardener.  &nbsp;Cold frame kits also make great Holiday gifts for that gardener that has everything. Gardeners can never have too much planting space. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;-DIY Insulation</strong></p>



<p>You can insulate with almost anything. Straw bales work great. Bubble wrap and reflective insulation work great too. Insulation can also remove drafts. However fiberglass insulation can be problematic. Animals like to nest in it. It can get all over if not contained and sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have seen people use outdoor Christmas light nets to increase the heat bed of seedling trays. They would have to be tradition lights, not LED because LED don’t get warm enough.  You would need to make sure  the lights are in good working order.&nbsp; You need to check them daily for damage.&nbsp; Also, this is not a solution to be done for a long time. It will work great for a few weeks to start seedlings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>I have built several cold frames over the years.&nbsp; Almost all have been from material that have been laying around.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. &nbsp; I have a quick and dirty video that will be posted soon.&nbsp; I hope you will share some of your DIY cold frames.&nbsp; I would love to see the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a good website about cold frame from the University of Iowa.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/yard-and-garden-all-about-cold-frames">Yard and Garden: All about Cold Frames | News</a></p>



<p>What about Row Covers?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about Row Covers?</h2>



<p>&nbsp; Row covers are an excellent for season extension. A row cover is a blanket usually made of spun poly material. It can protect plants from frosts and pests.&nbsp; These are temporarily installed to help enhance plant growth during the spring or fall by increasing temperature and humidity.&nbsp; Row covers can give 2-7 degrees F of frost protection.&nbsp; Row Covers also can protect a crop from insect pests.&nbsp; They are a temporary measure and usually gives a grower 4-6 weeks of extended growth. &nbsp; A row cover also gives wind protection to young plants.&nbsp; Most row covers can be reused for 2-3 years. &nbsp; The are relatively inexpensive choice for season extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619hG5NJ4ZL._AC_SL1001_.jpg" alt="" style="width:372px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Plant Covers Freeze Protection 10 ft x 30 ft Floating Row Cover 0.9oz/yd² Garden Fabric Plant Cover for Winter Frost/Sun Pest Protection (10FT X 30FT)  <a href="https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH">https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What the row cover is made of can make a difference. Most commonly it is a spun poly-synthetic material. &nbsp; It feels a bit like gauze.&nbsp; This material allows for air flow and water to filter though. &nbsp; The type of row cover you use will decide how much protection you will have.&nbsp; Generally, there are three weights of row covers.&nbsp; Light, medium and heavy weight fabric.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Light weight is best for insect barriers. They also have great light transmittance. upwards of 90%&nbsp;It protects against light frosts. </p>



<p>&#8211; Medium weight is best for frost protection for spring and fall crops. Medium will give about 4-6 degrees of frost protection and has about 85% light penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Heavy weight is best for heavy frost and over wintering of plants. The light penetration for heavy weight is about 50%</p>



<p>Row covers have one great advantage. They are useful when you want to cover already established plants like strawberry or raspberries. They are also helpful for garden plants.&nbsp;It is relatively easy to add row cover over an established plant and can extend your harvest. &nbsp; Depending on the crops, just put the cover over the crop and secure it with staples or bricks. For taller plants, the row covers can be supported by PVC or wire bows to make a tunnel.&nbsp; Make sure the ends are secured from wind and animals</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages or row covers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Weeding under a row cover can be problematic and may require pulling the row cover off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-If you grow a crop that relies on pollinators, a row crop may hinder pollination. You should pull it back to allow for adequate pollination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8211; It also can be time consuming to pull row covers off. This is especially challenging in windy conditions.</p>

<p>&#8211; Mice love to nest in row cover in the off season. You will need to store the row covers in a mouse proof box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Severe weather can tear and rip up a row cover.</p>



<p>&#8211; The row crop material can also tear on stems or plants during windy conditions</p>



<p>&#8211; In some areas, recycling the row cover is problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Row cover are a great addition to your cold frames.&nbsp; Both of these tools can be used to increase you harvest and lengthen you growing season.&nbsp; I would love to see how you are use these tools in you garden and homestead.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week many will see our first frost of the Autumn. &nbsp; The first frost marks the end of the growing season. It signals it is time to put our outdoor endeavors to sleep for the winter. Some are still actively harvesting and caring for the last fruits or vegetables out of the garden.&nbsp; This late in the season there should only be a few crops left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frosts are inevitable in the Midwest. &nbsp; Locally, we have experienced a long period of warm weather. It is dry and giving us an extended summer this year. &nbsp; We are well within the normal period for the first frost. The first frost can happen anywhere from Oct 1 &#8211; Nov 1 and be well within average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a difference between a frost and a freeze.&nbsp; Some people will use the two words interchangeably but there is a difference.&nbsp; A frost occurs when a thin layer of ice forms on a surface. This happens when the surface temperature is on or near 32 degrees F. &nbsp; A freeze occurs when the air temperature is 32 degrees or below for a significant period of time. A hard freeze happens when the air temperature is 28 degrees or lower for an extended period.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>What will happen to the&nbsp; apples, pumpkins, and other late-season vegetable crops?</strong></p>



<p>But what about the apples? Can we go to the apple orchard and still pick apples? I haven&#8217;t gotten my Apple Cider donuts yet this year. The answer is yes. Apples are pretty resilient to colder temperatures. Commercially, apples are stored 30-32 degrees F, so a little frost should not be of concern. Apples will freeze at a temperature between 27.8 and 29.4 *F, depending on the cultivar, and frozen fruit will deteriorate rapidly. By the time these temperatures happen we have already had some minor frosts and hopefully your apples have been harvested. If a freeze is predicted, there is not much one can do. It is impractical to try and protect large trees or if you have many trees. If frost is a huge concern, you should apply blankets or tarps over one or two dwarf trees. However, this would only give a couple of degrees of protection. This could be done to protect fruit if they are unripe and there are only one or two frosts predicted. This would be impractical for a longer amount of time. If the fruits are ripe, they should be picked and either used or stored. If fruit are not ripe, they will not mature substantially once they are removed from the tree. So it is important to keep the fruit on the tree to ripen. </p>

<p><strong>What about the Pumpkin Spice?</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Pumpkins should be protected from frost.&nbsp; Pumpkins can tolerate a light frost. However, a hard frost or freeze will decrease their storage life. You will be left with mushy pumpkins.&nbsp; Most of the pumpkin vine has shriveled up by now&nbsp; so you should harvest your pumpkins. &nbsp; If you still have vines that are growing, you can offer a few degrees of protection. Cover the plants with blankets and such. However, it may not be worth the time and trouble.&nbsp; Pumpkins are best stored at 50-55º F if they want to keep them at their best until Halloween. &nbsp; And wait to carve pumpkins until closer to Halloween, once the outer skin has been opened up pumpkins deteriorate quickly and even quicker if it is freezing</p>



<p><strong>What About My Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Other vegetable plants vary in their sensitivity to cold temperatures.&nbsp; Tender crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, and okra, might withstand light frost if protected.&nbsp; Blankets and tarps are only protective for a few degrees. &nbsp; If temperatures dip into the 20’s, covering the plants won’t likely provide enough protection and the plants will freeze.&nbsp; Harvest all the remaining fruit and vegetables of these plants. The frost will damage the fruit, making them mushy and unappetizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some cool season crops such as beets, carrots, lettuce, and potatoes will stand a light frost even without covering. They can be harvested after frost. Some root crops can stay in the ground and be harvested throughout the winter.&nbsp; This only works in areas that are consistently cold. Otherwise, the root crops will rot in the ground with repeated freeze thaw cycles.&nbsp; &nbsp; Other cool season crops, like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi, will tolerate even a light freeze. These crops can actively grow in cooler temperatures and handle several frosts before the plant starts to have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How Do I Protect My Garden?</strong></p>

<p> In my opinion mulching is the best way to protect your garden.  Mulching is a good way to protect very small gardens.  Use several layers of newspaper, straw or chopped corn stalks.  For those with large gardens, it may be more practical to protect only a few plants of each crop.  Blankets, tarps, floating row covers, or other large materials can be placed over rows of vegetables for protection.  There are a lot of products on the market that can help you extend your gardening season. Most are very effective. Cloches, paper tents, hot caps, and plastic walls of water are the more effective but expensive ways for frost protection.  All frost protection takes more time and effort on your part.  You can cause more damage if these are left on when the days are warm, but the nights are cold.  In cases of light frost, sometimes only the upper and outer foliage are damaged. The plants can still continue production.  </p>



<p>If plant covering is not feasible, pick as much produce as possible if frost is predicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What About My Tomatoes?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Most crops will not ripen any further once picked, but tomatoes are an exception. Mature green tomatoes can be ripened to full color indoors.&nbsp; Light is not necessary to ripen tomatoes.&nbsp; In fact, ripening of tomatoes is mostly affected by temperature.&nbsp; The warmer the temperature, the faster the ripening. Extensive warmth will over ripen your tomatoes before you get a chance to eat them. &nbsp; To store tomatoes for later use, wrap the fruit individually in newspaper and store at 55 degrees F. &nbsp; Make sure the tomatoes have no blemishes or soft spots.&nbsp; The fruits will gradually ripen in several weeks. This can give you garden fresh tomatoes well into the late fall, early winter.&nbsp; Some varieties of tomatoes store better then others varieties such as Roma or San Marzano. I once had a client that was so good at storing tomatoes that they would store them into January. &nbsp; They had a root cellar that had perfect temperatures. They were meticulous about getting rid of tomatoes with blemishes.&nbsp; They would take a few tomatoes out, warm them up and they would ripen. My client loved having fresh tomatoes in January. Many gardeners would envy them for having a fresh tomato during this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use this information to help plan next year&#8217;s garden. Plant fruit and vegetables that can extend your gardening season.&nbsp; Knowing which plants tolerate frost is important. It is also crucial to know which ones aren&#8217;t frost tolerant. This knowledge is key to being able to harvest your garden well into the Autumn.&nbsp; Your tender plants would need the most protection.&nbsp; Planting them so you can install hoops or some other way to easily put frost protection over the plants in the spring will make it much easier in the fall when you are extending your season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Vegetable Tolerance Chart</strong></p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown vegetables and indicates their tolerance to frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)</td><td>Semi-Hardy<br>(Tolerant light frost)<br></td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Beans</td><td>Beets</td><td>Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td>Cucumber</td><td>Carrot</td><td>Brussels sprouts</td></tr><tr><td>Eggplants</td><td>Cauliflower</td><td>Cabbage</td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand Spinach</td><td>Celery</td><td>Collards</td></tr><tr><td>Okra</td><td>Chard</td><td>Kale</td></tr><tr><td>Pepper</td><td>Chinese Cabbage</td><td>Kohlrabi</td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>Endive</td><td>Mustard Greens</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td><td>Lettuce</td><td>Onion</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Corn</td><td>Parsnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet potato</td><td>Potato</td><td>Peas</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato</td><td>Salsify</td><td>Radish</td></tr><tr><td>Watermelon</td><td></td><td>Spinach</td></tr><tr><td>Melons</td><td></td><td>Turnip</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Herb Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Herbs can be more difficult to figure out which ones are frost tolerant and which ones are not. Several herbs are perennial, meaning they die back every year and come back in the spring. &nbsp; Herbs are a little different because they have some different modes of survival.&nbsp; Some Herbs are annuals but will sow their seeds and then come back each year from the seed from the previous year. These are not technically cold hardy plants but their seed survives. Some self sewing in cold temp&nbsp;are cilantro/coriander, dill, borage, calendula,&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" data-attachment-id="339" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/10/17/understanding-first-frost-and-its-impact-on-your-garden/frost-garden/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="frost garden" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=750" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-339" style="width:324px;height:auto" srcset="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=150 150w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another type of herb life cycle that can also come back are Biennials. Biennial plants are plants that come back and complete their life cycle in two seasons.&nbsp; Biennials&nbsp;herbs include angelica, caraway, clary, parsley, watercress. These will die back then come back in the spring to complete there life cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown herbs and indicates their tolerance to frost.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)<br></td><td>Semi Hardy<br>(Tolerate light frost)</td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Basil</td><td>Lavender</td><td>Chives</td></tr><tr><td>Rosemary</td><td>Catnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Rue</td><td>Hyssop</td><td>Mint</td></tr><tr><td>St. Johns wort</td><td>Comfrey</td><td>Sorrel</td></tr><tr><td>Valerian</td><td>Feverfew</td><td>Tarragon</td></tr><tr><td>Chamomile</td><td>Lemon Balm</td><td>Thyme</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Lovage</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Fruits Trees?</strong></p>



<p>Fruit&nbsp; and cold tolerance has many different factors. There are three stages of cold hardiness. One stage,&nbsp; is the plant. Can the plant survive the cold temperature?&nbsp; The second, is  the fruit, can the fruit deal with frost or cold temperature.&nbsp; Third, and perhaps most importantly, what stage is the plant in when the cold temperatures occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the fruit plants, most fruit trees commonly found in the Midwest can handle pretty cold temperatures and survive.&nbsp; In the fall most of the fruit on plants have already been harvested except for apples and some pears.&nbsp; Apples are a special fruit as their fruit can withstand some frosts. &nbsp; Some people may have raspberry plants that has put on a second crop in the fall. These berries are very susceptible to a frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The plant stage has more to do with surviving frost than anything else.&nbsp; The flowering stage is the most sensitive for all fruiting plants. &nbsp; This is why we hear a lot about spring frosts hurting the fruit crops.&nbsp; Spring frost will kill flower tissue and hurt the plant&#8217;s pollination. So, for most fruit plant spring frost are the most dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Strawberries have other concerns about overwintering. They do best when mulched overwinter to help the crowns survive.&nbsp; Summer producing fruit only has to worry about frosts in the spring.&nbsp; Apricots, most berries, peaches, plums, and nectarines are very susceptible to frost injury in the spring, by the time autumn frost happens these plants have already been harvested.&nbsp;</p>
