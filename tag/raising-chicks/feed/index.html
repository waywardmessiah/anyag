<p>Coccidiosis is a common and deadly parasitic disease that affects chickens and other poultry. Coccidiosis in birds is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria. These microscopic organisms infect the intestinal lining of birds, leading to the symptoms we discussed earlier. Here are the main factors contributing to the spread and development of coccidiosis:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life Cycle of Eimeria</strong></h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Oocysts in the Environment</strong>: Infected birds shed oocysts (the part that can infect birds) in their droppings.</li>



<li><strong>Ingestion</strong>: Other birds ingest these oocysts when pecking at contaminated feed, water, or bedding.</li>



<li><strong>Sporulation</strong>: Oocysts need to sporulate (develop into an infective stage) in a warm, moist environment. This process can take a few days.</li>



<li><strong>Invasion</strong>: Once ingested, the sporulated oocysts invade the intestinal cells of the new host, causing damage and triggering the symptoms of coccidiosis.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Contributing Factors</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1441" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/08/understanding-coccidiosis-in-chickens-causes-and-symptoms/chick-and-egg-3/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/chick-and-egg-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1421" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chick and egg" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/chick-and-egg-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/chick-and-egg-1.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="757" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/chick-and-egg-1.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1441" /></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Poor Hygiene</strong>: Dirty coops, contaminated feed and water, and wet bedding can create an environment conducive to the spread of oocysts.</li>



<li><strong>High Stocking Density</strong>: Overcrowded conditions increase the likelihood of birds coming into contact with infected droppings.</li>



<li><strong>Stress</strong>: Stress factors such as poor nutrition, abrupt changes in environment, introduction of new birds or handling can weaken the birds&#8217; immune systems, , making them more susceptible to infection.</li>



<li><strong>Age</strong>: Young birds are particularly vulnerable to coccidiosis because their immune systems are not fully developed.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong></p>



<p>Coccidiosis in birds, particularly chickens, can present a range of symptoms. Here are some common signs to watch for:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1438" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/08/understanding-coccidiosis-in-chickens-causes-and-symptoms/tripple-chicks-3/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tripple-chicks.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="tripple chicks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tripple-chicks.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tripple-chicks.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tripple-chicks.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1438" /></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lethargy</strong>: Infected birds may appear weak, less active, and may huddle together.</li>



<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong>: Watery or bloody droppings are a typical symptom.</li>



<li><strong>Loss of Appetite</strong>: Affected birds may eat less or stop eating altogether.</li>



<li><strong>Pale Combs and Wattles</strong>: The combs and wattles may appear paler than usual.</li>



<li><strong>Weight Loss</strong>: Birds may lose weight and appear thin.</li>



<li><strong>Ruffled Feathers</strong>: Feathers may appear fluffed or ruffled.</li>



<li><strong>Decreased Egg Production</strong>: Laying hens may produce fewer eggs.</li>
</ul>



<p>These symptoms can vary in severity, depending on the strain of Eimeria and the overall health and age of the birds. If you notice any of these signs, it&#8217;s important to take action quickly to prevent the spread of the disease within your flock. Consulting a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment is always recommended.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1439" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/08/understanding-coccidiosis-in-chickens-causes-and-symptoms/two-chicks/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/two-chicks.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="two chicks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/two-chicks.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/two-chicks.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/two-chicks.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1439" /></figure>



<p>The only definitive method to diagnose coccidiosis is through fecal or blood tests. If you suspect coccidiosis, it&#8217;s advisable to initiate treatment promptly, as chicks can succumb to this parasite rapidly.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fecal Test</strong>: A fecal sample can be tested by a vet to confirm the presence of Eimeria eggs.</li>



<li><strong>Blood Test</strong>: A Complete Blood Count (CBC) may show decreased red blood cell and total protein levels.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>



<p>Treating coccidiosis in birds requires a combination of medication, supportive care, and environmental management. Here are the common treatment options:</p>

<li>In some cases, vaccination may not be feasible for large flocks. However, if you have experienced issues with coccidiosis in the past, it is worth considering vaccination as a preventive measure. Prior incidents of the disease indicate a higher risk, and vaccination can provide an additional layer of protection to safeguard the health of your flock. Always weigh the benefits and limitations to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Health Checks</strong>: Monitor your flock regularly for any signs of illness and take prompt action if you notice any symptoms of coccidiosis.</li>



<li><strong>Fecal Testing</strong>: Periodically test fecal samples for the presence of coccidia to catch infections early and take preventive measures.</li>
</ul>



<p>Implementing these preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of coccidiosis in your flock and help maintain their overall health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coccidiosis can be a serious issue, but with prompt treatment and good management practices, your flock can recover and thrive. If you suspect your chickens have coccidiosis, it&#8217;s best to consult a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Raising baby chicks can be a delightful and fulfilling endeavor, but it requires careful planning and attention to detail. From the moment your chicks hatch, they depend on you for warmth, nutrition, and a safe environment. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to ensure your chicks grow into healthy, happy chickens. Whether you&#8217;re a first-time chick parent or an experienced poultry keeper, these tips will help you provide the best care for your feathered friends. Let&#8217;s dive into the world of chick-rearing and discover how to create a nurturing home for your new flock.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After Your Chicks Hatch</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll need a large tote, livestock trough, or wooden box with clean, dry bedding (pine shavings). A heat lamp is essential, as well as water (preferably chick waterers) and medicated chick starter. Nutrition is crucial at this stage, as chicks can be susceptible to coccidiosis if conditions are wet and dirty. Watch for bloody stools.</p>

<p>Chicks need access to heat but should also have room to move away from it. The floor should be flat but not slick; paper towels work well for a few days, but wood shavings are ideal as they are more absorbent than straw. Food and water should be within a short walk from the heat source. You may want to keep them indoors for a few days if it&#8217;s really cold outside.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chick Box/Brooders</strong></h3>

<p>For the first week or two, use a brooder with a heat source. Place lights at one end so chicks can move away if they&#8217;re too hot. Use two lights if the brooder is in an unheated building during cold weather, in case one burns out. Use chick feed, either medicated or non-medicated, and provide fresh, clean water every day. Some people use a cardboard box or water/feed troughs to keep chicks in, with wood shavings as bedding. There are kits for brooding too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Brooder House</strong></h3>



<p>For brooding a lot of chicks, use wood shavings, multiple feeders, and multiple heat lamps if it&#8217;s cold. Keep water above the shavings.  Make sure there is enough room for all of the chicks.  Chicks can get board and start picking at each other.  </p>

<p>As chicks feather out, their heat needs lessen. Raise the heat lamp every week as they grow feathers. They will need more space as they grow.  When setting up a brooding box make sure the chicks can get out from under the lights.  Watch out for feather picking if the chicks are too close together with nothing else to do. Provide entertainment like a chick block (DIY) or greens.</p>



<p>Heat Lamps or Heat Pad are necessary to keep chicks helpful</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Dissolve 1 packet of unflavored gelatin in ½ cup hot water. Pour the mixture over 2 ½ &#8211; 3 cups of scratch grain. Mix thoroughly and pack into a mold. Place in the refrigerator to harden.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feather Picking</strong></h3>



<p>Feather picking is a common problem due to overcrowding and boredom. Chicks with plenty of room and access to the outdoors have fewer picking problems. Prevention includes providing plenty of space, food, and water. It also involves keeping them busy with leafy alfalfa hay, heads of cabbage, grass clippings, styrofoam, or baby blocks (gelatinized scratch grain). Treatment may involve culling victims, removing &#8220;pickers,&#8221; getting them out on grass, and dusting birds with Sevin or permethrin if there are signs of mites.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feed</strong></h3>



<p>As a general rule when you start your chick you want to use a chick starter. They can be medicated or unmediated. Medicated feeds are to prevent coccidiosis. a deadly disease that can kill the chicks.  If you have had issues with coccidiosis in the past it is a good idea to use a medicated feed.  </p>

<p><strong>Starter (18-28% protein)</strong>:   There are some options. One options include 26-28% turkey starter for 3 weeks, then 18-22%, or 18-22% starter/grower for the first 18-22 weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Layer (16-18% protein)</strong>: Start at 18-22 weeks of age with females. It has a higher calcium percentage than starter/grower. A layer feed has been formulated for chicken egg production. </p>



<p><strong>Feed for Meat Birds</strong>: Need higher protein percentages than layers. Use 23-28% for the first three weeks and finish with 20-22% broiler ration.  This kind of feed is formulated weight gain for broilers.   </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Good Feed Makes a Difference</strong></h3>



<p>Two Light Brown Leghorn pullets at 6 months of age, with the same parents and hatch date, can show differences in size and maturity based on their feed. One raised on cracked corn (7% protein) and the other on commercial poultry starter (22% protein).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pellet or Crumbles</strong></h3>



<p>Pellet and crumbles feed are two common forms of chicken feed, each with its own advantages. Pellets are compact, cylindrical pieces of feed that are easy for chickens to pick up and eat. They reduce waste because chickens are less likely to scatter them around. Pellets also ensure that chickens get a balanced diet in every bite, as the ingredients are evenly distributed. On the other hand, crumbles are essentially pellets that have been broken down into smaller pieces. They are easier for younger chickens or those with smaller beaks to eat. Crumbles can also be more palatable for some chickens, encouraging them to eat more. Ultimately, the choice between pellets and crumbles depends on the specific needs and preferences of your flock.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading alignwide"><strong>1-5 Months of Chicks&#8217; Life</strong></h3>



<p>Chicks should be fully feathered and can be let outside on warm days. Separate quick-maturing males from other birds to prevent harm to hens. Adult plumage comes in towards the end of this stage. Egg layers should start laying eggs around 16-20 weeks, depending on the breed. At this stage, chicks should be in their permanent coop to protect them from predators. Coops can be in old unused buildings or sheds. A place to roost is necessary for the health and comfort of your birds.</p>

<p>Grass and clover are nutritious, give birds something to do, and keep them cleaner. Chickens and grazing grass might not be the most common pairing, but they can actually complement each other quite well. Chickens are natural foragers and love to peck at the ground, searching for insects, seeds, and other tasty morsels. When allowed to roam on grazing grass, they can help control pests and fertilize the soil with their droppings. The grass, in turn, provides a soft and nutritious environment for the chickens to explore and enjoy. This symbiotic relationship can lead to healthier chickens and more robust grass, creating a sustainable and harmonious ecosystem. Plus, watching chickens happily clucking and scratching around in the grass is a delightful sight for any farmer or backyard enthusiast.</p>

<p>Fencing chicken runs is essential for ensuring the safety and well-being of your flock. A well-constructed fence keeps predators like foxes, raccoons, and stray dogs at bay, providing a secure environment for the chickens to roam and forage. It also prevents the chickens from wandering off and getting lost or injured. When choosing a fence, consider materials like galvanized wire mesh or hardware cloth, which are durable and resistant to rust. The height of the fence should be at 5-6 feet to deter climbing predators and prevent the chickens from flying over. Additionally, burying the fence a few inches into the ground can help prevent burrowing animals from gaining access.  Electric fence netting is an effective way to keep predators out and chickens in. </p>

<p>Another important aspect of fencing chicken runs is creating a comfortable and spacious area for the chickens to move around. A larger run allows the chickens to exhibit natural behaviors like scratching, pecking, and dust bathing, which are crucial for their physical and mental health. Providing shade and shelter within the fenced area can protect the chickens from harsh weather conditions and give them a place to rest. Regularly inspecting and maintaining the fence is also vital to ensure there are no gaps or weak spots that predators could exploit. By investing in a sturdy and well-designed fence, you can create a safe and enriching environment for your chickens to thrive.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cockerels</strong></h3>



<p>Cockerels are young male chickens that can show aggressive behavior. Males are useful for breeding and hatching eggs but are not necessary for egg-laying flocks. Separate cages may be needed for new birds in quarantine or brooding hens. Cages can be made from 1 x 2 inch wire and should be large enough for the birds.</p>
