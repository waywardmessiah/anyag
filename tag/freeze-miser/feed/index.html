<p>Frozen water Buckets!</p>



<p>&nbsp;Frozen Buckets!!&nbsp; You probably had to deal with frozen water for your livestock.&nbsp; Frozen livestock water is the bane of almost all animal farmers. It doesn&#8217;t matter if its chickens or cattle, everyone deals with frozen water sometimes. There are hundreds of &#8220;tried and true &#8221; ways to keep your animal water open. There are a lot of homemade DIYs, and some may work. Each farm is unique.  This discussion of how to keep livestock waters open encompass the most successful ideas. &nbsp; Let me know what works for you. I would love to see your ideas.</p>



<p>There are many types of electric heaters out on the market for every type of animal. These can range from being pretty inexpensive to very expensive. Some have many bells and whistles to ensure your water is open and animals are safe. The biggest drawback to electric waters is the need to have electricity run to where your water is needed. This can get complicated when you have multiple waters to keep open. </p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Electric Heaters</h2>



<p>Most electric heaters will not melt ice but rather keep existing liquid water open. It is important to start using electric heaters when the water is still open and liquid. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Electric Cords</h5>



<p>Running extension cords can be dangerous. Many cords  are not rated for outdoors and wet areas. Animals can chew on the cords becoming a shock risk. Running multiple extension cords can put extra load on circuits. Always have an electrician look at your electricity to make sure your circuits can handle the extra load. This is also a wise idea to make sure there hasn&#8217;t been damage over the summer to the wires. Barn fires happen all the time, most are caused by electrical issues. If in doubt, consult an electrician. This extra step can save you thousands of dollars and a world of heartache.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bucket Heaters</h3>



<p>Bucket heaters and trough heaters are popular, pretty inexpensive and effective as long as the animals will leave them alone. &nbsp; I had a horse that liked to play with the floating trough heater.&nbsp; He would rip the heater out of the wall and play with it in the pasture. After breaking the heater a couple of times, we got a submersible trough heater. We also got a deeper trough and kept the water filled so he wouldn&#8217;t pull it out. What about the pipes?&nbsp; Again, there are numerous ways to heat up pipes to keep them frost free. Wrap exposed pipes with insulation, rubber, or foam pipe covers. You can also use blankets, towels, or layers of newspaper.&nbsp; Beware, if you are also using some electrical means of frost prevention make sure the cord is protected from animals and in good working order.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enclosed Pump and/or Tank</h3>



<p>Enclose the pump and tank: Contact a licensed well contractor to help enclose your pump and tank. It&#8217;s really hard to pump water if you pump is frozen.&nbsp; Winterizing the pump can prevent damage from the elements and ensure it is working all winter long.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Insulate</h2>



<p>Insulate: Put a water bucket inside a larger bucket and fill the space with straw, hay, or shavings.&nbsp; This is a good solution if you don&#8217;t have weeks and weeks of freezing temperatures. Insulated buckets are also a good choice but can be more expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Solar Power</h3>



<p>Use solar power: Black buckets absorb the sun&#8217;s heat. You can cover part of a water trough with a solar cover. Snow cover can be an issue with using solar heat. This works best with a large trough of water that has access to the sun to warm it.&nbsp; On the market now there are some solar powered trough heaters.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compost</h2>



<p>Use compost: Pile compost around the buckets or troughs to use the heat from composting.&nbsp; The main issue with this is keeping the compost out of the buckets so it doesn&#8217;t contaminate the water.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Freeze Miser</h3>



<p>Use a Freeze Miser: This device helps keep water dripping as temperatures reach freezing levels.&nbsp; Freeze Miser automatically adjusts the water’s flow rate to the water temperature. As a result, you don’t waste more water than necessary to prevent it from freezing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Propane Heater</h3>



<p>Use a propane heater: Propane heaters can keep water warm even if the electricity goes out. However, propane can be expensive and dangerous, so make sure to buy a heater with a good safety rating.&nbsp; Propane heaters can be an issue when there is a lot of flammable debris around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Constant Flow Water</h3>



<p>Use a constant flow waterer: These can work well in temperatures well below zero Fahrenheit. If temperature remains low this watering system can have a heated component to make sure the water doesn&#8217;t freeze.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manure</h3>



<p>Use manure: Fill a tank with fresh manure and bank around the sides, leaving an area for drinking. This can work as the manure breaks down it will warm up the tank. This system has issues with animals being exposed to parasites. Manure can also be introduced to the water which leads to contamination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pop Bottles</h3>



<p>Use pop bottles: Put pop bottles containing salt water into small tanks. The tanks can still freeze if the freezing temperatures remain low for an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nesting Tanks</h3>



<p>Nest a smaller tank inside a larger one: Use bottom shims to bring the smaller rim above the larger. The air around the smaller tank acts as insulation to help keep the water open. This is effective with freezing temperatures that don&#8217;t last a long time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heated Hoses</h3>



<p>Heated hoses. These can be very expensive. A heated hose is more than wrapping heat tape around a hose. They are specially designed to handle heat and water. Avoid using heat tape alone. You might find out that the hose has melted. This could short out your electricity.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What About Small Animals?</h2>



<p>Chickens, other poultry and rabbits are a special consideration when the weather turns cold.&nbsp; Chickens and Poultry need open water to be accessible but usually they are in small amounts that freeze quickly.&nbsp; There are many commercial products such as electric heated waters and heated bases to keep water open.&nbsp; Heated nipples work great for poultry.  Putting a bucket heater in the water works too as long as the water container won’t melt.&nbsp; Heated water bowls work great too. Be aware of DIY what were not intended to be waters such as crock pots or other household appliances. They were not meant to be used in barns or coops and are not meant to be run constantly.&nbsp; They are a fire hazard. Please be careful.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rabbits can be a challenge in winter. Rabbits do great in cold temperatures but watering them is pain.&nbsp; Using water bottles for small animals, will require you to change and unthaw the bottles a couple times a day. If you are using crocks for water, then the crocks will need to be emptied and refilled. I recommend going with plastic crocks for the winter as ceramic crock may break. &nbsp; Rabbit watering systems it can be pretty easy to add a heated component to keep water flowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Water</h3>



<p>How much water you need?&nbsp; Every animal needs fresh, clean water every day. The amount of water any animal needs is dependent on the animal species and use.&nbsp; For example, beef cow will use less water than a dairy cow in milk production. Animals can change their water consumption based on other factors like, if they are lactating or breeding.&nbsp; Your water needs to accommodate your animals water needs. &nbsp; When the temperature gets colder animals tend to drink less.&nbsp; Animals under stress and poor water quality can lead to animals getting dehydrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><strong>Animal</strong></td><td colspan="2"><strong>Water Consumption, Typical</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>(Gallons per Day)</strong></td><td><strong>(liter per day)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chickens/100</td><td>6</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cow, Dry</td><td>15</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Milking Cows</td><td>35</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy Calves (1-4 months)</td><td>2.4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy Heifers (5 &#8211; 24 months)</td><td>6.6</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Dry Cows</td><td>9.3</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Hog</td><td>4</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Horse, Steer</td><td>12</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Pig, feeder</td><td>1.1 &#8211; 2</td><td>5 &#8211; 9</td></tr><tr><td>Sheep</td><td>2</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Rabbits</td><td>1-2 oz per pound</td><td>50-150 ml per kilo</td></tr><tr><td>Goats</td><td>1-3&nbsp;</td><td>4-5&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Llama/ Alpaca</td><td>2-5 gallons</td><td>7.5 &#8211; 19&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Turkeys/100</td><td>20</td><td>75</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Water tends to hold on to heat. It releases the heat when the air temperature is colder than the water.&nbsp; Large amounts of water hold more heat and in turn release more heat. Large bodies of water freeze over last because of the heat that is in the water. &nbsp; Mist rising from the surface of a pond is an indication that the pond is warmer than the current air temperature.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easier to keep a large trough open rather than several small buckets.&nbsp; If all you have are buckets. You will need to knock out ice to refill them frequently throughout the day when it is freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ice that forms on top of a bucket or trough can insulate the rest of the water, slowing the water from freezing. &nbsp; With a large trough, sometimes, it&#8217;s better not to break all the ice off the top to help insulate the rest of the trough.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There&#8217;s Plenty of Snow?!</h2>



<p>While sometimes there is more snow then we know what to do with it. Snow is not a reliable option for watering your animals.&nbsp; Some animals will eat snow, but they are likely not getting enough moisture through snow alone.&nbsp; Snow also can be contaminated and can be dirty. &nbsp; Some animals simply cannot eat enough snow to get enough liquid.&nbsp; Snow is cold and can lead to some animal getting frostbite.&nbsp; Remember it takes 10-13 inches of snow to equal 1 inch of rain.&nbsp;  For example, it will take 10 gallons of snow to make up 1 gallon of water.&nbsp; &nbsp;Animal especially large animals will find it is impossible for them to “eat” enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor or Outdoor</h2>



<p>Where your water is placed will affect how well your water solutions work. Is the water indoors or outdoors?</p>



<p>Indoor water will be protected from weather and wind. It is more likely to stay open when the temperatures are near 32 degrees F. Water being indoors has the benefit of not being in the weather so routine care can be easier. Indoor water can be messy and when the water thaws, can be a big mess inside your shelters.&nbsp; Making sure you have good drainage.  When the water does decide to melt, will save a lot of mud and muck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Outdoor watering is what most people with grazing animals have to deal with.&nbsp; Outdoor water situations can be great or can be hazardous.&nbsp; When using stock tanks, or an automatic waterer, animals tend to hang around the water if there isn&#8217;t enough grazing or forage.   Animals hanging round the can pit up the ground making is muddy ground around the tanks. If the ground is frozen it can be slippery and/or uneven ground causing hoof injury.  Adding Geo fabric or gravel around trough and water sources can reduce mud and hoof injury.  </p>



<p>I wanted to mention a quick mention about farm emergencies.  Most commonly when the power goes. This can affect you water pumps or water heaters.  Need to make a plan to deal with water emergencies.   How can you make sure you animals will get what they need?  Have a plan.  Are you ready?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quick Note: About Generators</h3>



<p>If you can afford a generator that is wonderful.  Make sure it is in good working order and winterized every year.  What is your generator able to handle as far as output.  Can it run you well pump? Is it powerful enough to run electricity to your house?   Know what the capacity is before bad weather. Make a plan on what you would the generator for.  </p>



<p>Dealing with frozen water is not a lot of fun. Farmers have been dealing with this for a very long time. Technology has some great way to deal with frozen water for livestock. It is worth the time and money to put in a system that will work for your farm.   Have a plan, execute plan. make adjustments as necessary.   </p>

<p>&nbsp; Keeping your fresh Christmas tree safe by making sure you are watering enough.&nbsp; A cut Christmas tree can go through a quart of water for every inch in diameter. For example, a 7-foot tree with a 3–4-inch trunk can use 3-4 quarts of water a day. That&#8217;s around a gallon! I have a whole blog post that just came out on Christmas trees and their care. Take a look at last week&#8217;s blog post on Christmas trees. <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/11/08/why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/">Why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/</a></p>

<p><strong>Fresh Greenery</strong></p>



<p>Now is a great time to trim evergreens for fresh holiday greenery.&nbsp; Spruce, pine and hollies make great holiday greenery because it smells great and is biodegradable. &nbsp; Winter is a perfect season to trim evergreens. There is less insects and diseases in winter, so the plants have time to heal. </p>



<p><strong>Holly</strong></p>

<p>Holly greenery is always popular for the holidays.&nbsp; The red berries and glossy leaves make this a particularly beautiful plant for your holidays.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have any red berries, you may have a male plant. You need to plant a female plant to get those berries.&nbsp; When trimming for greenery, put the ends in water until they are needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Caring for Other Christmas Plants like Amaryllis and Cyclamen&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For anyone who loves plants, amaryllis bulbs and cyclamen are a wonderful gift. Giving something that is green and blooming can lift the spirit of any scrooge. These plants have become popular to have during the holiday season as alternative to poinsettias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amaryllis bulbs grow tall with large blooms. They are a really gorgeous plant to have as a centerpiece for the holidays. They seem to grow with little care. If you have Amaryllis from last year, it should start growing for the next bloom cycle. After the flower is spent make sure the flower is completely yellowed, then cut the stalk. Make sure it is in a sunny place. This ensures the leaves can still get enough sun. The bulb needs to store enough nutrients to bloom again. Be aware that amaryllis is toxic to cats and dogs</p>

<p>Cyclamens have such beautiful lasting color when the winter can be very dull and gray. Cyclamen plants prefer cool temps to bloom and grow. Temperatures between 60-65 Degrees F. &nbsp; They require indirect sunlight to bloom.&nbsp; This plant is a tender perennial and goes dormant during the summer. It is commonly grown as a houseplant and the unique foliage is enjoyed until it goes dormant.&nbsp; Cyclamen is toxic to pets so keep your plant protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Christmas Cactus</strong></p>



<p>Reblooming Christmas and Thanksgiving Cacti Christmas Cactus and Thanksgiving Cactus  are popular flowering holiday plants.  Christmas cactus normally has smooth stem segments.&nbsp;Thanksgiving Cactus has hook-like appendages on each segment.  </p>



<p>Flowering will not occur unless induced by temperature and/or light treatment. If the temperature is held at 50 to 55 degrees F, flowering will occur regardless of day length. But flowering usually is not uniform. Temperatures below 50 degrees F prevent flowering. Nights greater than 12 hours long and temperatures between 59 and 69 degrees also can generate flowers. Twenty-five consecutive long nights is enough for flower initiation. It takes an additional nine to 10 weeks for flowers to complete development and bloom.</p>

<p>Both of these cacti like bright indirect light. Too much sun may cause leaves to turn yellow. Common household temperatures are fine. Keep soil constantly moist but not waterlogged. These plants seem to flower best if kept a little pot bound. If you need to repot you cactus, wait until spring.</p>

<p><strong>House Plants</strong></p>



<p>House plants that you brought in from outside should be getting used to being inside.&nbsp; Make sure they are not getting over watered as their growth will slow down in the winter months</p>



<p>&nbsp;Check for brown or dry edges. This indicates that the plant would do well with some more humidity.&nbsp; This can be done with a cold mist humidifier, pebble trays or grouping plants together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Houseplants in this time of year may not get enough light because the days are short and gray.&nbsp; Keep the plant away from cold windows as the foliage may die. &nbsp; Adding a supplemental light source until the days start getting longer will help the plants maintain their foliage</p>



<p><strong>Forcing Bulbs</strong></p>



<p>Remember the bulbs you put in the refrigerator last month? This month is great for forcing bulbs and getting that amazing pop of color in the winter.&nbsp; If you forgot to get your bulbs in the cooler, buy pre-chilled bulbs. Forced bulbs make a great gift to give other gardeners or anyone who misses being outdoors when it&#8217;s cold. &nbsp; The bulbs needs to be planted in moist soils and put in a warm bright place. They should bloom in 2-4 weeks depending on variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Things To Do In The Yard</strong></p>



<p>Cabin fever has got the best of you. There are a few tasks you can do outside. These tasks will improve your yard and your mood giving you a jump start on spring.</p>



<p><strong>Salt and Snow Melt</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Avoid using sodium chloride to melt snow and ice on your driveway or sidewalks. This causes damage to the plants in the adjacent areas and can damage any brick work too.&nbsp; Use something safer like potassium chloride or calcium chloride.&nbsp; Better yet, use sand or kitty litter for traction on slick surfaces. This can always be swept up in the spring and won&#8217;t harm your plants.  It can save you a little money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Its Not To Late to Mulch</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you have mulch in your planting beds. Putting a thick layer of straw over root crops protects them. Mulching allows the crops to be harvested all winter long. You can harvest them a little at a time without having to store them inside. &nbsp; This works great with parsnips, carrots, leeks, and beets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check young and thin barked trees for splitting. Last month we talked about wrapping these trees with a tree wrap to prevent it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recommend using paint of any sort. Paint prevents the tree from getting adequate air to the trunk. Additionally, it can attract insects in the spring. &nbsp; Pay attention to south and southwest facing sides of the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;If cracking is happening, wrap those tree trunks now. This will give the plant a chance to heal the damage before spring. Make sure that you remove the wrapping just before the spring thaw. This ensures moisture isn&#8217;t being caught, causing rotting in the wound.</p>

<p>Look at your landscape&#8217;s broad leaves evergreen plants and evergreen trees. These could be your azalea, rhododendron or boxwood plants. Be on the watch for the leaves turning brown. This can happen due to excessive drying from the wind. If you have a particularly windy place in your landscape, protect those tender plants. Use burlap on the south and west sides to shield them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Salt Spray</strong></p>



<p>Be aware of salt spray from the street. This can cause a lot of damage to your landscape. If you notice salt spray, protect those plants with burlap. Polyethylene plant screens are also a good.&nbsp;&nbsp; White pines, cedars, boxwood and other evergreens are very sensitive to salt spray. These plants will have a difficult time in high traffic areas where salt and snow melt have occurred.  If salt spray is damaging a plant in your landscape, consider removing the plant and replace it in the spring.</p>

<p>Avoid shoveling any snow on shrubs or trees especially if it has salt or snow melt in it. &nbsp;This prevents winter burn of shrubs and keep them healthy.&nbsp;Shoveling snow can break branches and damage the shape of the shrubs too. Be aware of snowplows piling up snow. </p>



<p><strong>Garden Chemicals and Fertilizers</strong></p>



<p>Garden chemicals are sensitive to cold and freezing. This includes sprays liquid and fertilizers. Even if you are an organic gardener.&nbsp; Be sure you have them stored in a secure place that doesn&#8217;t freeze. Freezing can make the product unusable in spring. Inspect containers to make sure their labels are intact.  </p>

<p>Check any produce or tender bulbs in storage.&nbsp; It could be your dahlias or begonia tubers or potatoes. Throw out any bulbs that are molding, softening or shriveling.&nbsp; If you see several bulbs shriveling this indicates there isn&#8217;t enough humidity. You will need to add some humidity to preserve your harvest. One way to do this is to run a humidifier part of time. Leaving open water can lead to unwanted insects and critters getting into your produce.</p>

<p><strong>Care and Feeding of Your Compost Pile</strong></p>



<p>Turn your compost pile to ensure it is warm enough to destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Turning your compost pile encourages it to break down. turning in to wonderful compost for next years garden. &nbsp; If your compost pile is not warm enough make sure to add more green items like kitchen scraps. Make sure you are adding to your compost pile, so it is ready for spring. Good compost is the secret to a great garden.</p>



<p><strong>Frost Heaves</strong></p>



<p>Check for frost heaving. Frost heaving when the ground thaws and freezes. This can cause shallow rooted perennials to lift out of the ground. Indiana has a lot of these freeze-thaw cycles. If you discovered roots that have been pushed out of the ground gently push the roots back into the soil. If the soil is too frozen to put the roots back, cover roots with 3-4 inches of mulch. This should protect the roots until a thaw cycle to put the roots back underground.</p>

<p>By now you are probably had to deal with frozen water. Frozen livestock water is the bane of almost all animal farmers. It doesn&#8217;t matter, chickens to cattle everyone deals with frozen water sometimes. There are hundreds of &#8220;tried and true &#8221; ways to keep your water open. There are a lot of homemade DIY solutions, and some may work for you. Each farm is unique, and some work better than others. The following are the main ways that water is kept open for livestock. Let me know what works for you. I would love to see your ideas. Lets explore: electric heaters, nesting tanks, heated hoses, insulated buckets, solar options, composting, freeze miser, propane heaters, constant water flow and pop bottles with salt.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are many types of electric heaters out on the market for every type of animal. These can range from being pretty inexpensive to very expensive. Some have many bells and whistles to ensure your water is open and animals are safe. The biggest drawback to electric waters is the need of having electricity run to where your water is needed. This can get complicated when you have multiple waters to run. Running extension cords can be dangerous if they are not rated for wet areas. Animals can chew on the cords becoming a shock risk. It&#8217;s a good idea to have an electrician check your electricity. Ensure your circuits can handle the extra load and have not been damaged over the summer. Barn fires happen all the time, most are caused by electrical issues. This extra step can save you thousands of dollars and a world heartache.</li>
