Whether you’re a seasoned farmer or a newcomer eager to embrace the homesteading lifestyle, staying informed about the latest trends and innovations is key to success. From sustainable practices and permaculture to DIY projects and food preservation, the world of small farms and homesteads is brimming with exciting opportunities and challenges.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll delve into some of the hottest topics currently shaping the homesteading community. These trends not only reflect the evolving landscape of agriculture but also offer practical insights and inspiration for those looking to enhance their homesteading journey. Join us as we explore the cutting-edge practices and ideas that are making waves in the world of small farms and homesteads.</p>



<p>What does this all mean for you and your property? What&nbsp; do these topics include? How does this affect you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sustainable Living</strong>: Sustainable farming refers to agricultural practices that prioritize the long-term health and productivity of the land, environment, and community. It involves methods that maintain and enhance the natural resources and ecosystems that farming depends on</p>



<p>Focus on eco-friendly practices, such as composting, rainwater harvesting, and renewable energy sources.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Environmental Health</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1469" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/14/top-sustainability-trends-for-small-farm-homesteads/field-6723608_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/field-6723608_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="field-6723608_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/field-6723608_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/field-6723608_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="664" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/field-6723608_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1469" /></figure>



<p>Small farms that adopt sustainable practices help protect and improve the environment. Techniques like crop rotation, cover cropping, and organic farming reduce soil erosion, improve soil fertility, and minimize the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides. By maintaining healthy soil, small farms can grow nutrient-rich crops and support biodiversity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable practices promote efficient use of resources such as water, energy, and land. For instance, rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation help conserve water, while renewable energy sources like solar and wind power reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Efficient resource management is vital for the long-term viability of small farms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Economic Viability</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable farming can enhance the economic stability of small farms. By reducing input costs (e.g., buying fewer chemicals and relying more on natural processes), farmers can save money and increase their profit margins. Additionally, sustainably produced products often attract premium prices in the market, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resilience to Climate Change</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable practices can help small farms become more resilient to climate change. Diversifying crops, improving soil health, and conserving water resources can mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. This resilience ensures the farm can continue to operate and produce food despite environmental challenges.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community and Food Security</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable small farms contribute to local food security by providing fresh, healthy produce to the community. By reducing dependence on long supply chains, small farms ensure that food remains available even during disruptions. Moreover, sustainable farming practices often foster a sense of community and cooperation among local farmers, strengthening social ties and support networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Animal Welfare</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable farming practices prioritize the well-being of livestock. Providing animals with adequate space, access to pasture, and natural diets not only ensures their health and productivity but also aligns with ethical standards that many consumers care about. Happy, healthy animals contribute to the overall success and sustainability of the farm.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preserving Rural Heritage</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable small farms help preserve traditional farming knowledge and rural heritage. By embracing time-tested practices and integrating modern innovations, small farms can maintain cultural traditions while adapting to contemporary challenges. This preservation is important for maintaining the unique character and identity of rural communities.</p>



<p>In summary, sustainable living on small farms is essential for protecting the environment, enhancing economic viability, increasing resilience to climate change, ensuring food security, promoting animal welfare, and preserving rural heritage. By adopting sustainable practices, small farms can thrive and contribute positively to their communities and the planet.</p>

Let&#8217;s dive into the world of chick-rearing and discover how to create a nurturing home for your new flock.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After Your Chicks Hatch</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll need a large tote, livestock trough, or wooden box with clean, dry bedding (pine shavings). A heat lamp is essential, as well as water (preferably chick waterers) and medicated chick starter. Nutrition is crucial at this stage, as chicks can be susceptible to coccidiosis if conditions are wet and dirty. Watch for bloody stools.</p>

<p>Chicks need access to heat but should also have room to move away from it. The floor should be flat but not slick; paper towels work well for a few days, but wood shavings are ideal as they are more absorbent than straw. Food and water should be within a short walk from the heat source. You may want to keep them indoors for a few days if it&#8217;s really cold outside.  </p>

<p>For the first week or two, use a brooder with a heat source. Place lights at one end so chicks can move away if they&#8217;re too hot. Use two lights if the brooder is in an unheated building during cold weather, in case one burns out. Use chick feed, either medicated or non-medicated, and provide fresh, clean water every day. Some people use a cardboard box or water/feed troughs to keep chicks in, with wood shavings as bedding. There are kits for brooding too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Brooder House</strong></h3>



<p>For brooding a lot of chicks, use wood shavings, multiple feeders, and multiple heat lamps if it&#8217;s cold. Keep water above the shavings.  Make sure there is enough room for all of the chicks.  Chicks can get board and start picking at each other.  </p>

<p>As chicks feather out, their heat needs lessen. Raise the heat lamp every week as they grow feathers. They will need more space as they grow.  When setting up a brooding box make sure the chicks can get out from under the lights.  Watch out for feather picking if the chicks are too close together with nothing else to do. Provide entertainment like a chick block (DIY) or greens.</p>



<p>Heat Lamps or Heat Pad are necessary to keep chicks helpful</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Dissolve 1 packet of unflavored gelatin in ½ cup hot water. Pour the mixture over 2 ½ &#8211; 3 cups of scratch grain. Mix thoroughly and pack into a mold. Place in the refrigerator to harden.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feather Picking</strong></h3>



<p>Feather picking is a common problem due to overcrowding and boredom. Chicks with plenty of room and access to the outdoors have fewer picking problems. Prevention includes providing plenty of space, food, and water. It also involves keeping them busy with leafy alfalfa hay, heads of cabbage, grass clippings, styrofoam, or baby blocks (gelatinized scratch grain). Treatment may involve culling victims, removing &#8220;pickers,&#8221; getting them out on grass, and dusting birds with Sevin or permethrin if there are signs of mites.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feed</strong></h3>



<p>As a general rule when you start your chick you want to use a chick starter. They can be medicated or unmediated. Medicated feeds are to prevent coccidiosis. a deadly disease that can kill the chicks.  If you have had issues with coccidiosis in the past it is a good idea to use a medicated feed.  </p>

<p><strong>Starter (18-28% protein)</strong>:   There are some options. One options include 26-28% turkey starter for 3 weeks, then 18-22%, or 18-22% starter/grower for the first 18-22 weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Layer (16-18% protein)</strong>: Start at 18-22 weeks of age with females. It has a higher calcium percentage than starter/grower. A layer feed has been formulated for chicken egg production. </p>



<p><strong>Feed for Meat Birds</strong>: Need higher protein percentages than layers. Use 23-28% for the first three weeks and finish with 20-22% broiler ration.  This kind of feed is formulated weight gain for broilers.   </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Good Feed Makes a Difference</strong></h3>



<p>Two Light Brown Leghorn pullets at 6 months of age, with the same parents and hatch date, can show differences in size and maturity based on their feed. One raised on cracked corn (7% protein) and the other on commercial poultry starter (22% protein).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pellet or Crumbles</strong></h3>



<p>Pellet and crumbles feed are two common forms of chicken feed, each with its own advantages. Pellets are compact, cylindrical pieces of feed that are easy for chickens to pick up and eat. They reduce waste because chickens are less likely to scatter them around. Pellets also ensure that chickens get a balanced diet in every bite, as the ingredients are evenly distributed. On the other hand, crumbles are essentially pellets that have been broken down into smaller pieces. They are easier for younger chickens or those with smaller beaks to eat. Crumbles can also be more palatable for some chickens, encouraging them to eat more. Ultimately, the choice between pellets and crumbles depends on the specific needs and preferences of your flock.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading alignwide"><strong>1-5 Months of Chicks&#8217; Life</strong></h3>



<p>Chicks should be fully feathered and can be let outside on warm days. Separate quick-maturing males from other birds to prevent harm to hens. Adult plumage comes in towards the end of this stage. Egg layers should start laying eggs around 16-20 weeks, depending on the breed. At this stage, chicks should be in their permanent coop to protect them from predators. Coops can be in old unused buildings or sheds. A place to roost is necessary for the health and comfort of your birds.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading alignwide"><strong>Grass and Grazing Chickens</strong></h3>

<p>Grass and clover are nutritious, give birds something to do, and keep them cleaner. Chickens and grazing grass might not be the most common pairing, but they can actually complement each other quite well. Chickens are natural foragers and love to peck at the ground, searching for insects, seeds, and other tasty morsels. When allowed to roam on grazing grass, they can help control pests and fertilize the soil with their droppings. The grass, in turn, provides a soft and nutritious environment for the chickens to explore and enjoy. This symbiotic relationship can lead to healthier chickens and more robust grass, creating a sustainable and harmonious ecosystem. Plus, watching chickens happily clucking and scratching around in the grass is a delightful sight for any farmer or backyard enthusiast.</p>

<p>Fencing chicken runs is essential for ensuring the safety and well-being of your flock. A well-constructed fence keeps predators like foxes, raccoons, and stray dogs at bay, providing a secure environment for the chickens to roam and forage. It also prevents the chickens from wandering off and getting lost or injured. When choosing a fence, consider materials like galvanized wire mesh or hardware cloth, which are durable and resistant to rust. The height of the fence should be at 5-6 feet to deter climbing predators and prevent the chickens from flying over. Additionally, burying the fence a few inches into the ground can help prevent burrowing animals from gaining access.  Electric fence netting is an effective way to keep predators out and chickens in. </p>

<p>Another important aspect of fencing chicken runs is creating a comfortable and spacious area for the chickens to move around. A larger run allows the chickens to exhibit natural behaviors like scratching, pecking, and dust bathing, which are crucial for their physical and mental health. Providing shade and shelter within the fenced area can protect the chickens from harsh weather conditions and give them a place to rest. Regularly inspecting and maintaining the fence is also vital to ensure there are no gaps or weak spots that predators could exploit. By investing in a sturdy and well-designed fence, you can create a safe and enriching environment for your chickens to thrive.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cockerels</strong></h3>



<p>Cockerels are young male chickens that can show aggressive behavior. Males are useful for breeding and hatching eggs but are not necessary for egg-laying flocks. Separate cages may be needed for new birds in quarantine or brooding hens. Cages can be made from 1 x 2 inch wire and should be large enough for the birds.</p>

<p>New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5p6DIlO6g&amp;t=1s">YouTube Video on my about cold frames</a>!!  Check it out!!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to have fresh vegetables after your garden has finished. &nbsp; It feels great to thwart the natural ending to the growing session and continue to grow vegetables for your family. Using cold frames and row covers to extend your growing season is one easy solution. The best part is, that it&#8217;s not hard to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are affiliate links it this article</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cold Frames</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never ready for the end of the growing season.  Frost seems to come out of nowhere and kill the growing season. Cold frames are great for protecting plants from frost. Planting cold season crops in a cold frame helps with the &#8220;Growing Seasons Over&#8221; blues.  The growing seasons not over, not yet, not if you have a cold frame. &nbsp; Garden fresh vegetables in late fall early winter is amazing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z+wLj6aAL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Giantex Wood Cold Frame, Mini Garden Greenhouse, Transparent Flip Top Lid, Bottomless Planter Raised Bed for Vegetable and Flowers, Indoor and Outdoor Patio&#8230; <br><a href="https://amzn.to/410nafS">https://amzn.to/410nafS</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cold frames are also great for getting ready for the growing season.&nbsp; They warm the soil up early. This allows seed planting to happen several weeks early. Giving you a jump on the growing season. Cold frames are great at protecting young plants from late frosts in the spring. Having a few extra weeks of growth can get your garden off to a great start. &nbsp; Cold frames create a humid environment that encourages plant growth and produces bigger plants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a cold frame?</h3>



<p></p>



<p>A cold frame is essentially a box with a transparent cover.&nbsp; This box acts as a small greenhouse for your plants. They protect plants from the elements, especially frost, wind and cold temperatures.&nbsp; A micro-climate&nbsp;is created using solar energy and the ground as insulation. They are great for starting plants in the spring and growing cold tolerant plants in the fall.&nbsp; They can also be used to overwinter dormant plants. The cold frames usually stay a bit warmer throughout the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware you have made a little greenhouse, and these little greenhouses can get quite warm with good sunshine. It is not uncommon for them to get above 90-degree F.&nbsp; High temperatures can damage young seedling.&nbsp; Getting a thermometer to monitor the temperature will help avoid any unfortunate seedling death. &nbsp;Cold season plants such as cabbage, radish and lettuce need cooler temps to grow well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Venting the cold frame when it is reaching higher temperature is necessary. &nbsp; </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watering</h3>



<p> Don&#8217;t forget to water the plants in your cold frames.&nbsp; Active plant growth will use water and can quickly dry the soil out.&nbsp; You may not need as much water as you would in the summer months. It is a good idea to watch the plants and make sure they have enough water.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hardening off your Seedlings</h3>



<p>For those who don’t know, hardening off seedlings is the process of acclimatizing them to the outside temperatures. It&#8217;s hard on seedlings that have been in a warm and moist environment to adjust to the outside weather.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hardening off is important. If seedlings are shocked, it can kill them or stunt their growth.  Start by gradually exposing the seedling to the outdoors. Leave your cold frame open for longer periods. Do this repeatedly over a couple of weeks.&nbsp; You can move plants into a shaded area to help the hardening off process. Then move them back to the cold frame to help them harden off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;-DIY Insulation</strong></p>



<p>You can insulate with almost anything. Straw bales work great. Bubble wrap and reflective insulation work great too. Insulation can also remove drafts. However fiberglass insulation can be problematic. Animals like to nest in it. It can get all over if not contained and sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&#8211; DIY Using Plastic Wood</strong></p>



<p>This is a bit harder. You can protect your box with paint to help resist water. Alternatively, using scraps of plastic wood from another project is a great idea. Use recycled plastic wood to maximize the benefit to your project and the environment.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; DIY Using Ground Cloth</strong></p>



<p>A DIY ground cloth. Using cardboard on the ground and some mulch will help insulate your box as well as help keep the heat.&nbsp; Using dark mulch will help with warming the box.</p>

<p>I have seen people use outdoor Christmas light nets to increase the heat bed of seedling trays. They would have to be tradition lights, not LED because LED don’t get warm enough.  You would need to make sure  the lights are in good working order.&nbsp; You need to check them daily for damage.&nbsp; Also, this is not a solution to be done for a long time. It will work great for a few weeks to start seedlings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have built several cold frames over the years.&nbsp; Almost all have been from material that have been laying around.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. &nbsp; I have a quick and dirty video that will be posted soon.&nbsp; I hope you will share some of your DIY cold frames.&nbsp; I would love to see the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a good website about cold frame from the University of Iowa.</p>

<p>What about Row Covers?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about Row Covers?</h2>



<p>&nbsp; Row covers are an excellent for season extension. A row cover is a blanket usually made of spun poly material. It can protect plants from frosts and pests.&nbsp; These are temporarily installed to help enhance plant growth during the spring or fall by increasing temperature and humidity.&nbsp; Row covers can give 2-7 degrees F of frost protection.&nbsp; Row Covers also can protect a crop from insect pests.&nbsp; They are a temporary measure and usually gives a grower 4-6 weeks of extended growth. &nbsp; A row cover also gives wind protection to young plants.&nbsp; Most row covers can be reused for 2-3 years. &nbsp; The are relatively inexpensive choice for season extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619hG5NJ4ZL._AC_SL1001_.jpg" alt="" style="width:372px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Plant Covers Freeze Protection 10 ft x 30 ft Floating Row Cover 0.9oz/yd² Garden Fabric Plant Cover for Winter Frost/Sun Pest Protection (10FT X 30FT)  <a href="https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH">https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What the row cover is made of can make a difference. Most commonly it is a spun poly-synthetic material. &nbsp; It feels a bit like gauze.&nbsp; This material allows for air flow and water to filter though. &nbsp; The type of row cover you use will decide how much protection you will have.&nbsp; Generally, there are three weights of row covers.&nbsp; Light, medium and heavy weight fabric.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Light weight is best for insect barriers. They also have great light transmittance. upwards of 90%&nbsp;It protects against light frosts. </p>



<p>&#8211; Medium weight is best for frost protection for spring and fall crops. Medium will give about 4-6 degrees of frost protection and has about 85% light penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Heavy weight is best for heavy frost and over wintering of plants. The light penetration for heavy weight is about 50%</p>



<p>Row covers have one great advantage. They are useful when you want to cover already established plants like strawberry or raspberries. They are also helpful for garden plants.&nbsp;It is relatively easy to add row cover over an established plant and can extend your harvest. &nbsp; Depending on the crops, just put the cover over the crop and secure it with staples or bricks. For taller plants, the row covers can be supported by PVC or wire bows to make a tunnel.&nbsp; Make sure the ends are secured from wind and animals</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages or row covers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Weeding under a row cover can be problematic and may require pulling the row cover off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-If you grow a crop that relies on pollinators, a row crop may hinder pollination. You should pull it back to allow for adequate pollination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8211; It also can be time consuming to pull row covers off. This is especially challenging in windy conditions.</p>

<p>&#8211; Mice love to nest in row cover in the off season. You will need to store the row covers in a mouse proof box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Severe weather can tear and rip up a row cover.</p>



<p>&#8211; The row crop material can also tear on stems or plants during windy conditions</p>



<p>&#8211; In some areas, recycling the row cover is problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Row cover are a great addition to your cold frames.&nbsp; Both of these tools can be used to increase you harvest and lengthen you growing season.&nbsp; I would love to see how you are use these tools in you garden and homestead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More information about row covers here are two great websites.&nbsp; They have great information.&nbsp; Enjoy!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t already brought your houseplants, now is the time. House plants that have been on the porch should have been protected enough from light frost. They should have been in a protected location. Houseplants that have been outside and just brought indoors will benefit from a trim. This trimming lessens the amount of foliage that will inevitably wilt and die.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal for houseplants to feel a little shocked when they return indoors after being outside all summer. &nbsp;Your houseplants will slow growing and will need less water and fertilizer.&nbsp; With leaf drop happening it is very easy to over water your indoor plants.&nbsp; You may need to move your houseplant to the sunniest areas. Add supplemental lighting if the leaf drop is becoming a mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Potting up Spring Flower Bulbs to Force Indoors in Mid Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Pot up spring flower bulbs such as daffodils and paper whites pot them up so just the tips are exposed.&nbsp; Then refrigerate for 10-13 weeks.&nbsp; After the cold period, put in a sunny location and allow it to grow. Blooms should happen in 3-4 weeks after putting them in sunny location. &nbsp; You will thank me later in the winter if you do this now.&nbsp; Also, you can just put the bulbs in the refrigerator and pot up in 10-13 weeks. It may take a little longer for the bulbs to bloom since they need to grow root system.</p>

<p>Put poinsettias in complete darkness from 5 pm to 8 am daily until early December. This routine will force the red (or other color) bracts to show. Once the leaves start to show color, you may bring them out of their dark routine.  A bract is the color that is shown on the leaves giving the poinsettia is colors. </p>



<p><strong>Outdoors, Things to Get Done.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of any really nice November days. Use this time to work on some outdoor tasks before you put up your Christmas lights. It will save yourself a ton of time, energy and work if you do some simple thing to get ready for winter</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Rodent Damage to Trees</strong></p>



<p>Prevent rabbit and rodent damage on trees by putting up physical barriers around trunks by using hardware cloth.&nbsp; The hardware cloth must be ¼ inch or less to be effective. Chicken wire is not going to help you out and it can be frustrating to work with.&nbsp; Chemical repellents are going to be less effective, are always temporary, expensive and not always foolproof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Young Trees Need Care Before Winter</strong></p>
