<p><strong>Home Greenhouses: A Guide to Extending Your Growing Season</strong></p>



<p>Greenhouses and cold frames are fantastic tools for any gardening enthusiast, offering opportunities to extend your growing season, start crops early, protect sensitive plants, and even grow year-round. These structures are perfect for getting your hands in the soil during colder months. For many, nurturing green, growing plants during the gray days of winter can bring a sense of hope and joy.</p>



<p>However, before you jump into owning a greenhouse, there are several important factors to consider. Thinking through these questions will help you choose the right greenhouse for your needs and ensure you’re prepared for this rewarding endeavor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Determining Your Purpose</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenline1/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg" data-orig-size="603,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GreenLine1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" width="603" height="477" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-1522" /></figure>



<p>Start by asking yourself: <strong>What’s the purpose of my greenhouse?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you want to grow year-round?</li>



<li>Are you cultivating orchids or other plants that require a temperature-controlled environment?</li>



<li>Do you need a head start on the growing season?</li>



<li>Is it part of a plan to expand your gardening operation for profit?</li>



<li>Are you look to grow fresh, off-season vegetables for your family?</li>



<li>Do you want a multi-functional structure that can serve different purposes?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re clear about how you’ll use the greenhouse, it’s time to dive deeper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Considerations</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do you have a suitable location?</strong> This is one of the most critical questions to address.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pay attention to how the sun’s position changes throughout the year, as this can affect light quality and intensity. Ensure your greenhouse gets adequate sunlight.</li>



<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> If possible, opt for an <strong>east-west orientation</strong> to distribute light evenly and maximize the winter sun. This setup is also better suited to handle prevailing winds, especially in windy regions.</li>



<li><img width="478" height="322" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3e5XMiFpB-oGcAKZcPKRvUQldjuI3IGZDDSX8IPZC5Lc1WtMK5hv5BrKxF1WvHKC321CekqeyRSjm31v5p-dpaumtuda22XUizK1bmz5c81Rk-IhP2E0CsCDXZgRDR-vFW8Pe?key=1k9zzEbJMXdDmcC7_JVjJhKn" alt="Sun Orentation1.gif"></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Before taking the plunge, take into account the following practical details:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Space:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient space and check for potential obstructions like trees and fences.</li>



<li><strong>Heating:</strong> Determine if you want a heat source you’ll use and budget for associated heating expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Consider local climate conditions, such as gray winter days, strong winds, snow fall and seasonal challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Slope and Drainage:</strong> Avoid placing your greenhouse at the bottom of a slope and ensure proper drainage to prevent water logging.  Also A greenhouse in a valley area will be colder then one that is on top of a hill. Cold air slides downhill. </li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Decide between automatic or manual ventilation to regulate temperature and humidity effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Electricity and Water:</strong> Ensure that your greenhouse has reliable access to electricity and water.</li>



<li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Plan for cooling solutions such as shade cloth, during summer months to prevent overheating.</li>



<li><strong>Zoning and Property Values:</strong> Check local ordinances for zoning regulations and consider how the greenhouse may impact neighborhood relations.</li>



<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Think about future needs—plan ahead for potential expansion as your gardening experience grows.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budget Planning</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1524" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/savings-2789137_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="savings-2789137_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1524" style="width:555px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p>When planning your project, the first question to ask yourself is, “How much am I willing to spend?” Setting a clear and realistic budget is crucial, as expenses can accumulate faster than anticipated. Beyond the initial costs, don’t overlook ongoing expenses such as electricity, water, and maintenance.  Recurring costs can significantly impact your long-term financial commitment.</p>



<p>While the allure of adding convenient features and premium upgrades may be tempting, staying within your budget ensures financial stability and prevents overspending. One smart strategy is to prioritize essential components first. Begin with a more basic setup that meets your immediate needs, and then enhance it gradually as resources allow. By pacing yourself, you’ll achieve a balance between functionality and affordability without compromising your financial goals.</p>



<p>Remember, a well-planned budget isn’t just about limiting spending—it’s about making the most of the resources you have while staying adaptable to future improvements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pests and Disease Management</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1526" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/aphid-5154237_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aphid-5154237_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1526" style="width:611px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p><strong>What’s your plan for managing pests and diseases?</strong> All greenhouses face these challenges eventually. Consider whether you’ll pursue organic methods and prepare a strategy to address these issues effectively. Learn to implement IPM.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong></h4>



<p>Integrated Pest Management combines multiple methods to create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to pest and disease control. IPM focuses on prevention, monitoring, and targeted interventions to minimize chemical use and maintain a healthy greenhouse ecosystem.</p>



<p>By implementing these strategies, you can maintain a thriving greenhouse environment and keep your plants healthy year-round. Let me know if you&#8217;d like me to expand further or focus on any specific pest or disease issue!</p>



<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in greenhouses is a strategic and environmentally conscious approach to pest control. It involves a combination of practices to manage pests effectively while minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Key components of IPM include regular monitoring of pest populations, accurate identification of pests, and the use of biological control agents such as beneficial insects or microorganisms. Cultural practices like maintaining optimal environmental conditions and sanitizing greenhouse spaces also play a vital role in preventing pest outbreaks. By integrating these methods, greenhouse growers can ensure sustainable pest management that protects crops, reduces chemical residues, and supports a healthier ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants to thrive, but they can also create a favorable setting for pests and diseases to multiply. The warm, humid conditions that benefit your plants may also attract unwanted visitors like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, or fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew and botrytis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Is Key</strong></h4>



<p>Taking proactive measures can help reduce the likelihood of outbreaks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep your greenhouse clean by removing plant debris and regularly disinfecting tools, pots, and surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Quarantine New Plants:</strong> Inspect and isolate new plants before introducing them to the greenhouse.</li>



<li><strong>Healthy Plants:</strong> Maintain proper care for plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure adequate airflow to prevent humidity from reaching levels that encourage fungal growth.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection</strong></h4>



<p>Constant vigilance is crucial for catching problems before they escalate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check plants frequently for signs of pests like holes, discoloration, sticky residue, or webbing.</li>



<li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Use yellow or blue sticky traps to monitor flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.</li>



<li><strong>Soil Checks:</strong> Periodically inspect soil for pests like fungus gnats or root-knot nematodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Control Methods</strong></h4>



<p>If issues arise, there are several ways to address them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewings, or predatory mites, to combat pests naturally.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Sprays:</strong> Use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or horticultural oils, to manage pests without harmful chemicals.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Rotate crops, avoid overcrowding, and remove infected plants promptly to limit the spread of diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> As a last resort, apply pesticides or fungicides, ensuring they are appropriate for the problem and safe for use in greenhouses. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disease-Specific Tips</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Prevent fungal issues by controlling humidity levels and avoiding overhead watering.</li>



<li><strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Avoid working with plants when they’re wet, as this can spread bacterial pathogens.</li>



<li><strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Viruses are often spread by pests like aphids. Manage pest populations to reduce the risk of viral transmission.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing Setup</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1528" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenhouse-827464_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="greenhouse-827464_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" /></figure>



<p>Think about the logistics of your greenhouse:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planting Methods:</strong> Will you grow directly in the ground, in raised beds, or on tables?</li>



<li><strong>Nutrient Delivery:</strong> How will you provide nutrients to your plants? Have a clear plan for their care and growth.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting Small</strong></h3>

<p>In this blog post, we’ll delve into some of the hottest topics currently shaping the homesteading community. These trends not only reflect the evolving landscape of agriculture but also offer practical insights and inspiration for those looking to enhance their homesteading journey. Join us as we explore the cutting-edge practices and ideas that are making waves in the world of small farms and homesteads.</p>



<p></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Environmental Health</strong></h5>



<p>Small farm Homesteads that adopt sustainable practices help protect and improve the environment. Techniques like crop rotation, cover cropping, and organic farming reduce soil erosion, improve soil fertility, and minimize the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides. By maintaining healthy soil, small farms can grow nutrient-rich crops and support biodiversity.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable practices promote efficient use of resources such as water, energy, and land. For instance, rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation help conserve water, while renewable energy sources like solar and wind power reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Efficient resource management is vital for the long-term viability of small farms.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1413" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/02/26/top-trends-for-small-farm-homesteads-for-sustainable-living/solar-panel-and-sheep-3/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/solar-panel-and-sheep.jpg" data-orig-size="6000,4000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="solar panel and sheep" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/solar-panel-and-sheep.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/solar-panel-and-sheep.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/solar-panel-and-sheep.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1413" style="width:560px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Economic Viability</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable farming can enhance the economic stability of small farms. By reducing input costs (e.g., buying fewer chemicals and relying more on natural processes), farmers can save money and increase their profit margins. Additionally, sustainably produced products often attract premium prices in the market, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resilience to Climate Change</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable practices can help small farms become more resilient to climate change. Diversifying crops, improving soil health, and conserving water resources can mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. This resilience ensures the farm can continue to operate and produce food despite environmental challenges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community and Food Security</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable small farms contribute to local food security by providing fresh, healthy produce to the community. By reducing dependence on long supply chains, small farms ensure that food remains available even during disruptions. Moreover, sustainable farming practices often foster a sense of community and cooperation among local farmers, strengthening social ties and support networks.</p>

<p>Sustainable farming practices prioritize the well-being of livestock. Providing animals with adequate space, access to pasture, and natural diets not only ensures their health and productivity but also aligns with ethical standards that many consumers care about. Happy, healthy animals contribute to the overall success and sustainability of the farm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preserving Rural Heritage</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable small farms help preserve traditional farming knowledge and rural heritage. By embracing time-tested practices and integrating modern innovations, small farms can maintain cultural traditions while adapting to contemporary challenges. This preservation is important for maintaining the unique character and identity of rural communities.</p>

<p>Sustainable living on small farms is essential for protecting the environment, enhancing economic viability, increasing resilience to climate change, ensuring food security, promoting animal welfare, and preserving rural heritage. By adopting sustainable practices, small farms can thrive and contribute positively to their communities and the planet.</p>



<p>Small farm homesteaders should keep an eye on several emerging trends that are likely to shape the future of homesteading:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Increased Focus on Sustainability and Self-Sufficiency</strong>: Homesteaders are increasingly prioritizing sustainable living and self-sufficiency, aiming to reduce their environmental footprint and reliance on external resources.</li>



<li><strong>Urban Homesteading</strong>: With more people moving to urban areas, urban homesteading is gaining popularity. This trend involves growing food and raising animals in urban settings, often using innovative methods like vertical gardening and rooftop farming.</li>



<li><strong>Permaculture</strong>: Interest in permaculture, a design system for creating sustainable human habitats by mimicking natural ecosystems, is on the rise. Permaculture principles can help homesteaders create more resilient and productive farms.</li>



<li><strong>Alternative Protein Sources</strong>: As awareness of environmental and ethical issues grows, there is a shift towards alternative protein sources such as insect farming, aquaponics, and plant-based proteins.</li>



<li><strong>Homesteading Skills</strong>: There is a renewed interest in learning traditional homesteading skills, such as food preservation, herbal medicine, and DIY projects. These skills can enhance self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on commercial products.</li>



<li><strong>Renewable Energy Solutions</strong>: Small farms are increasingly adopting renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power to reduce energy costs and environmental impact.</li>



<li><strong>Community and Food Security</strong>: Building strong local food systems and fostering community connections are becoming more important. Homesteaders are working together to create resilient food networks that can withstand disruptions.</li>



<li><strong>Technology Integration</strong>: Advances in technology, such as precision agriculture, smart irrigation systems, and data-driven farming, are helping homesteaders optimize their resources and improve productivity.</li>
</ol>



<p>By staying informed about these trends, small farm homesteaders can adapt and thrive in an ever-changing landscape, ensuring their farms remain sustainable, productive, and connected to their communities.</p>

<p>Small farm homesteading is more than just a trend; it’s a lifestyle rooted in sustainability, self-sufficiency, and community. As the homesteading movement continues to grow, the adoption of eco-friendly practices, resource efficiency, and resilient farming methods will play a crucial role in shaping the future of agriculture. By embracing these innovative approaches, small farms not only ensure their own economic viability but also contribute to environmental health, animal welfare, and local food security. The resurgence of traditional knowledge and rural heritage, combined with modern advancements, creates a harmonious balance that benefits both people and the planet. As we move forward, the collective efforts of the homesteading community will pave the way for a more sustainable and connected world.</p>

<p><strong>Note on Materials:</strong> Use treated or plastic wood for the base to ensure longevity and structural integrity. The plastic covering can be purchased inexpensively, and you might find role ends at a cheaper price. Wiggle wire, used in the greenhouse industry, makes adjusting the plastic easy. Greenhouse repair tape is UV-protected and more durable than clear plastic or duct tape. Pipe insulation is cheap and easy to find, and construction screws help ensure the structure stays together longer.</p>

<p><strong>Shape the Panels:</strong></p>



<p>For a more Gothic shape, bend the panels to create a point. This is an aesthetic choice leaving the round shape also helps reduce snow and wind load.</p>

<p>Cut angles in the 2x4s so the top point holds up the end of the panel. Measure to ensure the correct angle based on your base size.</p>

<p>You can install door frames on both ends for support, but one door frame is sufficient. The door frame supports the wire and serves as an entrance.</p>

<p>Use zip ties or greenhouse tape to attach pipe insulation to each end of the greenhouse. This reduces wear on the plastic covering.</p>

<p>This structure can be modified from here to be use for livestock or storage. Instead of adding clear plastic, add a tarp to offer shade and protection. On the ends of the structure, wire can be added to protect livestock. The possibilities are endless.</p>



<p>You should have a structure that looks like this:</p>

<p>Cover the main structure with plastic. Secure the plastic using furring strips and screws, or use wiggle wire for easier adjustments. If you are using furring strips and screws, Line up the one furring strip on either side of the cattle panels. Screw the furring strips together make sure you avoid the cattle panel wire. Screw to secure the plastic about 2 ½ feet from the bottom to allow for ventilation. You need to allow some overhanging plastic on the ground so you can role up the sides to allow venation. you will want to secure the plastic with cinder blocks, gravel or even dirt.</p>



<p><strong>Cover the Ends:</strong></p>

<p>New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5p6DIlO6g&amp;t=1s">YouTube Video on my about cold frames</a>!!  Check it out!!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to have fresh vegetables after your garden has finished. &nbsp; It feels great to thwart the natural ending to the growing session and continue to grow vegetables for your family. Using cold frames and row covers to extend your growing season is one easy solution. The best part is, that it&#8217;s not hard to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are affiliate links it this article</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cold Frames</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never ready for the end of the growing season.  Frost seems to come out of nowhere and kill the growing season. Cold frames are great for protecting plants from frost. Planting cold season crops in a cold frame helps with the &#8220;Growing Seasons Over&#8221; blues.  The growing seasons not over, not yet, not if you have a cold frame. &nbsp; Garden fresh vegetables in late fall early winter is amazing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z+wLj6aAL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Giantex Wood Cold Frame, Mini Garden Greenhouse, Transparent Flip Top Lid, Bottomless Planter Raised Bed for Vegetable and Flowers, Indoor and Outdoor Patio&#8230; <br><a href="https://amzn.to/410nafS">https://amzn.to/410nafS</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cold frames are also great for getting ready for the growing season.&nbsp; They warm the soil up early. This allows seed planting to happen several weeks early. Giving you a jump on the growing season. Cold frames are great at protecting young plants from late frosts in the spring. Having a few extra weeks of growth can get your garden off to a great start. &nbsp; Cold frames create a humid environment that encourages plant growth and produces bigger plants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a cold frame?</h3>



<p></p>



<p>A cold frame is essentially a box with a transparent cover.&nbsp; This box acts as a small greenhouse for your plants. They protect plants from the elements, especially frost, wind and cold temperatures.&nbsp; A micro-climate&nbsp;is created using solar energy and the ground as insulation. They are great for starting plants in the spring and growing cold tolerant plants in the fall.&nbsp; They can also be used to overwinter dormant plants. The cold frames usually stay a bit warmer throughout the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware you have made a little greenhouse, and these little greenhouses can get quite warm with good sunshine. It is not uncommon for them to get above 90-degree F.&nbsp; High temperatures can damage young seedling.&nbsp; Getting a thermometer to monitor the temperature will help avoid any unfortunate seedling death. &nbsp;Cold season plants such as cabbage, radish and lettuce need cooler temps to grow well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Venting the cold frame when it is reaching higher temperature is necessary. &nbsp; </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watering</h3>



<p> Don&#8217;t forget to water the plants in your cold frames.&nbsp; Active plant growth will use water and can quickly dry the soil out.&nbsp; You may not need as much water as you would in the summer months. It is a good idea to watch the plants and make sure they have enough water.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hardening off your Seedlings</h3>



<p>For those who don’t know, hardening off seedlings is the process of acclimatizing them to the outside temperatures. It&#8217;s hard on seedlings that have been in a warm and moist environment to adjust to the outside weather.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hardening off is important. If seedlings are shocked, it can kill them or stunt their growth.  Start by gradually exposing the seedling to the outdoors. Leave your cold frame open for longer periods. Do this repeatedly over a couple of weeks.&nbsp; You can move plants into a shaded area to help the hardening off process. Then move them back to the cold frame to help them harden off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cold frames are great for the DIY person. They are relatively simple to make and easy to use.&nbsp; Most of the time you can use materials you have on hand or can scavenge.&nbsp; Recycled materials for cold frames is a wonderful way to help the waste. &nbsp; The basic set up is a bottomless box with a piece of something&nbsp;clear to let the sun in.&nbsp; They can be as easy as placing a straw bale around your plants with a glass door on top. Alternatively, they can be a complicated woodworking project with an automatic opener and all the bells and whistles. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and Tricks to Cold Frames</h3>



<p>Insulating the box will help extend the season. Use insulation or bubble wrap or just some straw. &nbsp; This help eliminated any drafts</p>



<p>The cover doesn&#8217;t have to be totally clear. It has to let most of the light in. It can be a semitransparent film or poly carbonate.</p>



<p>Face your cold frame south.  This will capture the most sunlight. Winter sunlight can be weak but facing south makes the most of the sun that is available.&nbsp; Winter sun is on a different angle than summer sun. Utilize all the sunlight, as it is most beneficial to your plant.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bells and Whistles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can buy cold frames online if you are not a confident DIY person. They are nice option. They are quicker to get working. There is everything thing from your basic cold frame to deluxe models with nice bells and whistles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zweaVmnsL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" style="width:490px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">MCombo Wooden Garden Portable Greenhouse Cold Frame Raised Plants Bed Protection 6057-0690 (Orange)<a href="https://amzn.to/49aYZgB">https://amzn.to/49aYZgB</a></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8211; Kits have all the pieces and directions to help you build the cold frame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Kits sometimes come with automatic openers. These are great for hands-free ventilation of the cold frame. They work when it gets too warm then opens to allow the heat to escape. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Kits can have added insulation to the box will help remove drafts and help keep it warmer.</p>



<p>-Kits generally are made from a rot and disease resistant materials like plastic or treated wood to ensure a long-lasting cold frame</p>



<p>&#8211; Kits sometimes add black ground cloth to help warm the box and reduce weeds</p>



<p>-Some kits make it easy to add heat coils or seedling mats. These additions help keep it warm during colder temperatures for starting seeds.</p>



<p>-Kits are a great choice for the time crunched gardener.  &nbsp;Cold frame kits also make great Holiday gifts for that gardener that has everything. Gardeners can never have too much planting space. </p>



<p>If you have chosen to make your own cold frame, you can you add your own DIY bells and whistles.  You are absolutely able to add the DIY accessories.&nbsp; The best part of  building your own is that you can add whatever accessories you need.  Here is some suggestions to try. I am sure there are a lot of great ideas out there. Love to know what you have done. Please put  your ideas in the comments. </p>

<p>&#8211;<strong>DIY Automatic Openers</strong></p>



<p>You can buy an automatic opener and add it to your cold frame.&nbsp; Make sure it can lift your lid.&nbsp; Lids are often made from glass and glass is heavy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;-DIY Insulation</strong></p>



<p>You can insulate with almost anything. Straw bales work great. Bubble wrap and reflective insulation work great too. Insulation can also remove drafts. However fiberglass insulation can be problematic. Animals like to nest in it. It can get all over if not contained and sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have seen people use outdoor Christmas light nets to increase the heat bed of seedling trays. They would have to be tradition lights, not LED because LED don’t get warm enough.  You would need to make sure  the lights are in good working order.&nbsp; You need to check them daily for damage.&nbsp; Also, this is not a solution to be done for a long time. It will work great for a few weeks to start seedlings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>I have built several cold frames over the years.&nbsp; Almost all have been from material that have been laying around.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. &nbsp; I have a quick and dirty video that will be posted soon.&nbsp; I hope you will share some of your DIY cold frames.&nbsp; I would love to see the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a good website about cold frame from the University of Iowa.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/yard-and-garden-all-about-cold-frames">Yard and Garden: All about Cold Frames | News</a></p>



<p>What about Row Covers?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about Row Covers?</h2>



<p>&nbsp; Row covers are an excellent for season extension. A row cover is a blanket usually made of spun poly material. It can protect plants from frosts and pests.&nbsp; These are temporarily installed to help enhance plant growth during the spring or fall by increasing temperature and humidity.&nbsp; Row covers can give 2-7 degrees F of frost protection.&nbsp; Row Covers also can protect a crop from insect pests.&nbsp; They are a temporary measure and usually gives a grower 4-6 weeks of extended growth. &nbsp; A row cover also gives wind protection to young plants.&nbsp; Most row covers can be reused for 2-3 years. &nbsp; The are relatively inexpensive choice for season extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619hG5NJ4ZL._AC_SL1001_.jpg" alt="" style="width:372px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Plant Covers Freeze Protection 10 ft x 30 ft Floating Row Cover 0.9oz/yd² Garden Fabric Plant Cover for Winter Frost/Sun Pest Protection (10FT X 30FT)  <a href="https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH">https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What the row cover is made of can make a difference. Most commonly it is a spun poly-synthetic material. &nbsp; It feels a bit like gauze.&nbsp; This material allows for air flow and water to filter though. &nbsp; The type of row cover you use will decide how much protection you will have.&nbsp; Generally, there are three weights of row covers.&nbsp; Light, medium and heavy weight fabric.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Light weight is best for insect barriers. They also have great light transmittance. upwards of 90%&nbsp;It protects against light frosts. </p>



<p>&#8211; Medium weight is best for frost protection for spring and fall crops. Medium will give about 4-6 degrees of frost protection and has about 85% light penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Heavy weight is best for heavy frost and over wintering of plants. The light penetration for heavy weight is about 50%</p>



<p>Row covers have one great advantage. They are useful when you want to cover already established plants like strawberry or raspberries. They are also helpful for garden plants.&nbsp;It is relatively easy to add row cover over an established plant and can extend your harvest. &nbsp; Depending on the crops, just put the cover over the crop and secure it with staples or bricks. For taller plants, the row covers can be supported by PVC or wire bows to make a tunnel.&nbsp; Make sure the ends are secured from wind and animals</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages or row covers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Weeding under a row cover can be problematic and may require pulling the row cover off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-If you grow a crop that relies on pollinators, a row crop may hinder pollination. You should pull it back to allow for adequate pollination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8211; It also can be time consuming to pull row covers off. This is especially challenging in windy conditions.</p>

<p>&#8211; Mice love to nest in row cover in the off season. You will need to store the row covers in a mouse proof box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Severe weather can tear and rip up a row cover.</p>



<p>&#8211; The row crop material can also tear on stems or plants during windy conditions</p>



<p>&#8211; In some areas, recycling the row cover is problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Row cover are a great addition to your cold frames.&nbsp; Both of these tools can be used to increase you harvest and lengthen you growing season.&nbsp; I would love to see how you are use these tools in you garden and homestead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More information about row covers here are two great websites.&nbsp; They have great information.&nbsp; Enjoy!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Winter is setting in. The weather has gotten colder. For many of us, there is still plenty to do, especially if you have animals. In this newsletter, you will get some timely information about the plants and animals in your care.   There is still plenty of plant to take care of this season. Christmas trees, holly, Christmas cactus, amaryllis and cyclamen all have a special place during the holidays. Still a lot to do on the homestead too. Don&#8217;t forget to protect your trees and shrubs from salt and heavy snow.  Take care of your animal&#8217;s needs by exploring all the different ways to keep water from freezing.</p>

<p><strong>Christmas Trees</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; Keeping your fresh Christmas tree safe by making sure you are watering enough.&nbsp; A cut Christmas tree can go through a quart of water for every inch in diameter. For example, a 7-foot tree with a 3–4-inch trunk can use 3-4 quarts of water a day. That&#8217;s around a gallon! I have a whole blog post that just came out on Christmas trees and their care. Take a look at last week&#8217;s blog post on Christmas trees. <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/11/08/why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/">Why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/</a></p>

<p><strong>Fresh Greenery</strong></p>



<p>Now is a great time to trim evergreens for fresh holiday greenery.&nbsp; Spruce, pine and hollies make great holiday greenery because it smells great and is biodegradable. &nbsp; Winter is a perfect season to trim evergreens. There is less insects and diseases in winter, so the plants have time to heal. </p>



<p><strong>Holly</strong></p>

<p>Holly greenery is always popular for the holidays.&nbsp; The red berries and glossy leaves make this a particularly beautiful plant for your holidays.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have any red berries, you may have a male plant. You need to plant a female plant to get those berries.&nbsp; When trimming for greenery, put the ends in water until they are needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Caring for Other Christmas Plants like Amaryllis and Cyclamen&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For anyone who loves plants, amaryllis bulbs and cyclamen are a wonderful gift. Giving something that is green and blooming can lift the spirit of any scrooge. These plants have become popular to have during the holiday season as alternative to poinsettias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amaryllis bulbs grow tall with large blooms. They are a really gorgeous plant to have as a centerpiece for the holidays. They seem to grow with little care. If you have Amaryllis from last year, it should start growing for the next bloom cycle. After the flower is spent make sure the flower is completely yellowed, then cut the stalk. Make sure it is in a sunny place. This ensures the leaves can still get enough sun. The bulb needs to store enough nutrients to bloom again. Be aware that amaryllis is toxic to cats and dogs</p>

<p>Cyclamens have such beautiful lasting color when the winter can be very dull and gray. Cyclamen plants prefer cool temps to bloom and grow. Temperatures between 60-65 Degrees F. &nbsp; They require indirect sunlight to bloom.&nbsp; This plant is a tender perennial and goes dormant during the summer. It is commonly grown as a houseplant and the unique foliage is enjoyed until it goes dormant.&nbsp; Cyclamen is toxic to pets so keep your plant protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Christmas Cactus</strong></p>



<p>Reblooming Christmas and Thanksgiving Cacti Christmas Cactus and Thanksgiving Cactus  are popular flowering holiday plants.  Christmas cactus normally has smooth stem segments.&nbsp;Thanksgiving Cactus has hook-like appendages on each segment.  </p>



<p>Flowering will not occur unless induced by temperature and/or light treatment. If the temperature is held at 50 to 55 degrees F, flowering will occur regardless of day length. But flowering usually is not uniform. Temperatures below 50 degrees F prevent flowering. Nights greater than 12 hours long and temperatures between 59 and 69 degrees also can generate flowers. Twenty-five consecutive long nights is enough for flower initiation. It takes an additional nine to 10 weeks for flowers to complete development and bloom.</p>

<p>Both of these cacti like bright indirect light. Too much sun may cause leaves to turn yellow. Common household temperatures are fine. Keep soil constantly moist but not waterlogged. These plants seem to flower best if kept a little pot bound. If you need to repot you cactus, wait until spring.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>House Plants</strong></p>



<p>House plants that you brought in from outside should be getting used to being inside.&nbsp; Make sure they are not getting over watered as their growth will slow down in the winter months</p>



<p>&nbsp;Check for brown or dry edges. This indicates that the plant would do well with some more humidity.&nbsp; This can be done with a cold mist humidifier, pebble trays or grouping plants together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Houseplants in this time of year may not get enough light because the days are short and gray.&nbsp; Keep the plant away from cold windows as the foliage may die. &nbsp; Adding a supplemental light source until the days start getting longer will help the plants maintain their foliage</p>



<p><strong>Forcing Bulbs</strong></p>



<p>Remember the bulbs you put in the refrigerator last month? This month is great for forcing bulbs and getting that amazing pop of color in the winter.&nbsp; If you forgot to get your bulbs in the cooler, buy pre-chilled bulbs. Forced bulbs make a great gift to give other gardeners or anyone who misses being outdoors when it&#8217;s cold. &nbsp; The bulbs needs to be planted in moist soils and put in a warm bright place. They should bloom in 2-4 weeks depending on variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Things To Do In The Yard</strong></p>



<p>Cabin fever has got the best of you. There are a few tasks you can do outside. These tasks will improve your yard and your mood giving you a jump start on spring.</p>



<p><strong>Salt and Snow Melt</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Avoid using sodium chloride to melt snow and ice on your driveway or sidewalks. This causes damage to the plants in the adjacent areas and can damage any brick work too.&nbsp; Use something safer like potassium chloride or calcium chloride.&nbsp; Better yet, use sand or kitty litter for traction on slick surfaces. This can always be swept up in the spring and won&#8217;t harm your plants.  It can save you a little money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Its Not To Late to Mulch</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you have mulch in your planting beds. Putting a thick layer of straw over root crops protects them. Mulching allows the crops to be harvested all winter long. You can harvest them a little at a time without having to store them inside. &nbsp; This works great with parsnips, carrots, leeks, and beets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check young and thin barked trees for splitting. Last month we talked about wrapping these trees with a tree wrap to prevent it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recommend using paint of any sort. Paint prevents the tree from getting adequate air to the trunk. Additionally, it can attract insects in the spring. &nbsp; Pay attention to south and southwest facing sides of the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;If cracking is happening, wrap those tree trunks now. This will give the plant a chance to heal the damage before spring. Make sure that you remove the wrapping just before the spring thaw. This ensures moisture isn&#8217;t being caught, causing rotting in the wound.</p>

<p>Look at your landscape&#8217;s broad leaves evergreen plants and evergreen trees. These could be your azalea, rhododendron or boxwood plants. Be on the watch for the leaves turning brown. This can happen due to excessive drying from the wind. If you have a particularly windy place in your landscape, protect those tender plants. Use burlap on the south and west sides to shield them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Salt Spray</strong></p>



<p>Be aware of salt spray from the street. This can cause a lot of damage to your landscape. If you notice salt spray, protect those plants with burlap. Polyethylene plant screens are also a good.&nbsp;&nbsp; White pines, cedars, boxwood and other evergreens are very sensitive to salt spray. These plants will have a difficult time in high traffic areas where salt and snow melt have occurred.  If salt spray is damaging a plant in your landscape, consider removing the plant and replace it in the spring.</p>

<p>Avoid shoveling any snow on shrubs or trees especially if it has salt or snow melt in it. &nbsp;This prevents winter burn of shrubs and keep them healthy.&nbsp;Shoveling snow can break branches and damage the shape of the shrubs too. Be aware of snowplows piling up snow. </p>



<p><strong>Garden Chemicals and Fertilizers</strong></p>



<p>Garden chemicals are sensitive to cold and freezing. This includes sprays liquid and fertilizers. Even if you are an organic gardener.&nbsp; Be sure you have them stored in a secure place that doesn&#8217;t freeze. Freezing can make the product unusable in spring. Inspect containers to make sure their labels are intact.  </p>

<p>Check any produce or tender bulbs in storage.&nbsp; It could be your dahlias or begonia tubers or potatoes. Throw out any bulbs that are molding, softening or shriveling.&nbsp; If you see several bulbs shriveling this indicates there isn&#8217;t enough humidity. You will need to add some humidity to preserve your harvest. One way to do this is to run a humidifier part of time. Leaving open water can lead to unwanted insects and critters getting into your produce.</p>

<p><strong>Care and Feeding of Your Compost Pile</strong></p>



<p>Turn your compost pile to ensure it is warm enough to destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Turning your compost pile encourages it to break down. turning in to wonderful compost for next years garden. &nbsp; If your compost pile is not warm enough make sure to add more green items like kitchen scraps. Make sure you are adding to your compost pile, so it is ready for spring. Good compost is the secret to a great garden.</p>



<p><strong>Frost Heaves</strong></p>



<p>Check for frost heaving. Frost heaving when the ground thaws and freezes. This can cause shallow rooted perennials to lift out of the ground. Indiana has a lot of these freeze-thaw cycles. If you discovered roots that have been pushed out of the ground gently push the roots back into the soil. If the soil is too frozen to put the roots back, cover roots with 3-4 inches of mulch. This should protect the roots until a thaw cycle to put the roots back underground.</p>

<p>By now you are probably had to deal with frozen water. Frozen livestock water is the bane of almost all animal farmers. It doesn&#8217;t matter, chickens to cattle everyone deals with frozen water sometimes. There are hundreds of &#8220;tried and true &#8221; ways to keep your water open. There are a lot of homemade DIY solutions, and some may work for you. Each farm is unique, and some work better than others. The following are the main ways that water is kept open for livestock. Let me know what works for you. I would love to see your ideas. Lets explore: electric heaters, nesting tanks, heated hoses, insulated buckets, solar options, composting, freeze miser, propane heaters, constant water flow and pop bottles with salt.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are many types of electric heaters out on the market for every type of animal. These can range from being pretty inexpensive to very expensive. Some have many bells and whistles to ensure your water is open and animals are safe. The biggest drawback to electric waters is the need of having electricity run to where your water is needed. This can get complicated when you have multiple waters to run. Running extension cords can be dangerous if they are not rated for wet areas. Animals can chew on the cords becoming a shock risk. It&#8217;s a good idea to have an electrician check your electricity. Ensure your circuits can handle the extra load and have not been damaged over the summer. Barn fires happen all the time, most are caused by electrical issues. This extra step can save you thousands of dollars and a world heartache.</li>

<p>&nbsp;Even though it is November there is still plenty to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Soil sampling&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get soils sampling done before the ground freezes.&nbsp; Later fall is an ideal time.&nbsp; I explain solid sampling in my blog post about Soils.</p>

<p><strong>Bring House Plant Back Indoors</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t already brought your houseplants, now is the time. House plants that have been on the porch should have been protected enough from light frost. They should have been in a protected location. Houseplants that have been outside and just brought indoors will benefit from a trim. This trimming lessens the amount of foliage that will inevitably wilt and die.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal for houseplants to feel a little shocked when they return indoors after being outside all summer. &nbsp;Your houseplants will slow growing and will need less water and fertilizer.&nbsp; With leaf drop happening it is very easy to over water your indoor plants.&nbsp; You may need to move your houseplant to the sunniest areas. Add supplemental lighting if the leaf drop is becoming a mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Potting up Spring Flower Bulbs to Force Indoors in Mid Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Pot up spring flower bulbs such as daffodils and paper whites pot them up so just the tips are exposed.&nbsp; Then refrigerate for 10-13 weeks.&nbsp; After the cold period, put in a sunny location and allow it to grow. Blooms should happen in 3-4 weeks after putting them in sunny location. &nbsp; You will thank me later in the winter if you do this now.&nbsp; Also, you can just put the bulbs in the refrigerator and pot up in 10-13 weeks. It may take a little longer for the bulbs to bloom since they need to grow root system.</p>



<p><strong>Bring Poinsettias Back</strong></p>

<p>Put poinsettias in complete darkness from 5 pm to 8 am daily until early December. This routine will force the red (or other color) bracts to show. Once the leaves start to show color, you may bring them out of their dark routine.  A bract is the color that is shown on the leaves giving the poinsettia is colors. </p>



<p><strong>Outdoors, Things to Get Done.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of any really nice November days. Use this time to work on some outdoor tasks before you put up your Christmas lights. It will save yourself a ton of time, energy and work if you do some simple thing to get ready for winter</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Rodent Damage to Trees</strong></p>



<p>Prevent rabbit and rodent damage on trees by putting up physical barriers around trunks by using hardware cloth.&nbsp; The hardware cloth must be ¼ inch or less to be effective. Chicken wire is not going to help you out and it can be frustrating to work with.&nbsp; Chemical repellents are going to be less effective, are always temporary, expensive and not always foolproof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Young Trees Need Care Before Winter</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week many will see our first frost of the Autumn. &nbsp; The first frost marks the end of the growing season. It signals it is time to put our outdoor endeavors to sleep for the winter. Some are still actively harvesting and caring for the last fruits or vegetables out of the garden.&nbsp; This late in the season there should only be a few crops left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frosts are inevitable in the Midwest. &nbsp; Locally, we have experienced a long period of warm weather. It is dry and giving us an extended summer this year. &nbsp; We are well within the normal period for the first frost. The first frost can happen anywhere from Oct 1 &#8211; Nov 1 and be well within average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a difference between a frost and a freeze.&nbsp; Some people will use the two words interchangeably but there is a difference.&nbsp; A frost occurs when a thin layer of ice forms on a surface. This happens when the surface temperature is on or near 32 degrees F. &nbsp; A freeze occurs when the air temperature is 32 degrees or below for a significant period of time. A hard freeze happens when the air temperature is 28 degrees or lower for an extended period.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>What will happen to the&nbsp; apples, pumpkins, and other late-season vegetable crops?</strong></p>



<p>But what about the apples? Can we go to the apple orchard and still pick apples? I haven&#8217;t gotten my Apple Cider donuts yet this year. The answer is yes. Apples are pretty resilient to colder temperatures. Commercially, apples are stored 30-32 degrees F, so a little frost should not be of concern. Apples will freeze at a temperature between 27.8 and 29.4 *F, depending on the cultivar, and frozen fruit will deteriorate rapidly. By the time these temperatures happen we have already had some minor frosts and hopefully your apples have been harvested. If a freeze is predicted, there is not much one can do. It is impractical to try and protect large trees or if you have many trees. If frost is a huge concern, you should apply blankets or tarps over one or two dwarf trees. However, this would only give a couple of degrees of protection. This could be done to protect fruit if they are unripe and there are only one or two frosts predicted. This would be impractical for a longer amount of time. If the fruits are ripe, they should be picked and either used or stored. If fruit are not ripe, they will not mature substantially once they are removed from the tree. So it is important to keep the fruit on the tree to ripen. </p>

<p><strong>What about the Pumpkin Spice?</strong></p>

<p>Pumpkins should be protected from frost.&nbsp; Pumpkins can tolerate a light frost. However, a hard frost or freeze will decrease their storage life. You will be left with mushy pumpkins.&nbsp; Most of the pumpkin vine has shriveled up by now&nbsp; so you should harvest your pumpkins. &nbsp; If you still have vines that are growing, you can offer a few degrees of protection. Cover the plants with blankets and such. However, it may not be worth the time and trouble.&nbsp; Pumpkins are best stored at 50-55º F if they want to keep them at their best until Halloween. &nbsp; And wait to carve pumpkins until closer to Halloween, once the outer skin has been opened up pumpkins deteriorate quickly and even quicker if it is freezing</p>



<p><strong>What About My Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Other vegetable plants vary in their sensitivity to cold temperatures.&nbsp; Tender crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, and okra, might withstand light frost if protected.&nbsp; Blankets and tarps are only protective for a few degrees. &nbsp; If temperatures dip into the 20’s, covering the plants won’t likely provide enough protection and the plants will freeze.&nbsp; Harvest all the remaining fruit and vegetables of these plants. The frost will damage the fruit, making them mushy and unappetizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some cool season crops such as beets, carrots, lettuce, and potatoes will stand a light frost even without covering. They can be harvested after frost. Some root crops can stay in the ground and be harvested throughout the winter.&nbsp; This only works in areas that are consistently cold. Otherwise, the root crops will rot in the ground with repeated freeze thaw cycles.&nbsp; &nbsp; Other cool season crops, like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi, will tolerate even a light freeze. These crops can actively grow in cooler temperatures and handle several frosts before the plant starts to have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How Do I Protect My Garden?</strong></p>

<p> In my opinion mulching is the best way to protect your garden.  Mulching is a good way to protect very small gardens.  Use several layers of newspaper, straw or chopped corn stalks.  For those with large gardens, it may be more practical to protect only a few plants of each crop.  Blankets, tarps, floating row covers, or other large materials can be placed over rows of vegetables for protection.  There are a lot of products on the market that can help you extend your gardening season. Most are very effective. Cloches, paper tents, hot caps, and plastic walls of water are the more effective but expensive ways for frost protection.  All frost protection takes more time and effort on your part.  You can cause more damage if these are left on when the days are warm, but the nights are cold.  In cases of light frost, sometimes only the upper and outer foliage are damaged. The plants can still continue production.  </p>



<p>If plant covering is not feasible, pick as much produce as possible if frost is predicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What About My Tomatoes?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Most crops will not ripen any further once picked, but tomatoes are an exception. Mature green tomatoes can be ripened to full color indoors.&nbsp; Light is not necessary to ripen tomatoes.&nbsp; In fact, ripening of tomatoes is mostly affected by temperature.&nbsp; The warmer the temperature, the faster the ripening. Extensive warmth will over ripen your tomatoes before you get a chance to eat them. &nbsp; To store tomatoes for later use, wrap the fruit individually in newspaper and store at 55 degrees F. &nbsp; Make sure the tomatoes have no blemishes or soft spots.&nbsp; The fruits will gradually ripen in several weeks. This can give you garden fresh tomatoes well into the late fall, early winter.&nbsp; Some varieties of tomatoes store better then others varieties such as Roma or San Marzano. I once had a client that was so good at storing tomatoes that they would store them into January. &nbsp; They had a root cellar that had perfect temperatures. They were meticulous about getting rid of tomatoes with blemishes.&nbsp; They would take a few tomatoes out, warm them up and they would ripen. My client loved having fresh tomatoes in January. Many gardeners would envy them for having a fresh tomato during this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use this information to help plan next year&#8217;s garden. Plant fruit and vegetables that can extend your gardening season.&nbsp; Knowing which plants tolerate frost is important. It is also crucial to know which ones aren&#8217;t frost tolerant. This knowledge is key to being able to harvest your garden well into the Autumn.&nbsp; Your tender plants would need the most protection.&nbsp; Planting them so you can install hoops or some other way to easily put frost protection over the plants in the spring will make it much easier in the fall when you are extending your season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Vegetable Tolerance Chart</strong></p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown vegetables and indicates their tolerance to frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)</td><td>Semi-Hardy<br>(Tolerant light frost)<br></td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Beans</td><td>Beets</td><td>Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td>Cucumber</td><td>Carrot</td><td>Brussels sprouts</td></tr><tr><td>Eggplants</td><td>Cauliflower</td><td>Cabbage</td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand Spinach</td><td>Celery</td><td>Collards</td></tr><tr><td>Okra</td><td>Chard</td><td>Kale</td></tr><tr><td>Pepper</td><td>Chinese Cabbage</td><td>Kohlrabi</td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>Endive</td><td>Mustard Greens</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td><td>Lettuce</td><td>Onion</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Corn</td><td>Parsnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet potato</td><td>Potato</td><td>Peas</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato</td><td>Salsify</td><td>Radish</td></tr><tr><td>Watermelon</td><td></td><td>Spinach</td></tr><tr><td>Melons</td><td></td><td>Turnip</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Herb Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Herbs can be more difficult to figure out which ones are frost tolerant and which ones are not. Several herbs are perennial, meaning they die back every year and come back in the spring. &nbsp; Herbs are a little different because they have some different modes of survival.&nbsp; Some Herbs are annuals but will sow their seeds and then come back each year from the seed from the previous year. These are not technically cold hardy plants but their seed survives. Some self sewing in cold temp&nbsp;are cilantro/coriander, dill, borage, calendula,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another type of herb life cycle that can also come back are Biennials. Biennial plants are plants that come back and complete their life cycle in two seasons.&nbsp; Biennials&nbsp;herbs include angelica, caraway, clary, parsley, watercress. These will die back then come back in the spring to complete there life cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What About My Fruits Trees?</strong></p>



<p>Fruit&nbsp; and cold tolerance has many different factors. There are three stages of cold hardiness. One stage,&nbsp; is the plant. Can the plant survive the cold temperature?&nbsp; The second, is  the fruit, can the fruit deal with frost or cold temperature.&nbsp; Third, and perhaps most importantly, what stage is the plant in when the cold temperatures occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the fruit plants, most fruit trees commonly found in the Midwest can handle pretty cold temperatures and survive.&nbsp; In the fall most of the fruit on plants have already been harvested except for apples and some pears.&nbsp; Apples are a special fruit as their fruit can withstand some frosts. &nbsp; Some people may have raspberry plants that has put on a second crop in the fall. These berries are very susceptible to a frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The plant stage has more to do with surviving frost than anything else.&nbsp; The flowering stage is the most sensitive for all fruiting plants. &nbsp; This is why we hear a lot about spring frosts hurting the fruit crops.&nbsp; Spring frost will kill flower tissue and hurt the plant&#8217;s pollination. So, for most fruit plant spring frost are the most dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Strawberries have other concerns about overwintering. They do best when mulched overwinter to help the crowns survive.&nbsp; Summer producing fruit only has to worry about frosts in the spring.&nbsp; Apricots, most berries, peaches, plums, and nectarines are very susceptible to frost injury in the spring, by the time autumn frost happens these plants have already been harvested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fall officially arrived in the Midwest! I am totally looking ahead to the cool weather and of course pumpkin spice. What I&#8217;m most excited about more than anything else is fall color. Despite the fact we have had very warm days.  We are seeing some signs of Fall. Some fall colors have already started. Black walnuts and their leaves have been raining down. Burning bushes have started to turn a brilliant red. Soon Autumn will be a riot of color. Unfortunately, this year, we may find our colors a little muted since we spent a late summer in drought conditions.</p>



<p>Why do the trees and shrubs change colors?</p>



<p> Trees and shrubs that lose their leaves are starting to ready themselves for winter. The days start getting shorter and the night longer. This change signals the plants to start the process of breaking down the chlorophyll in the leaves. The chlorophyll is what causes the leaves to be green. Without chlorophyll, the plant can no longer produce its own food. The plant is forced to go into storage mode. Storage mode helps the plant store its food to help it through the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old wives tales </p>



<p>There are many factors that contribute to Fall color. There are also old wives tales about fall color.&nbsp; One old wife&#8217;s tail is that dry weather and frost promote the brightest leaf color.&nbsp; This is unfortunately untrue but there are other factors that can give the most spectacular fall color.&nbsp; The three factors are the pigments in the leaf, the length of night and weather. </p>



<p>The best fall colors</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The best fall coloration occurs when we have cool nights in the forties. Warm afternoons in the sixties and seventies also contribute. Adequate rainfall is essential for bright fall colors. The sugars that promote the bright reds and oranges are produced in these weather conditions.&nbsp; The pigment is the leaves that cause the bright colors are carotenoids and anthocyanins. Drought conditions can cause the leaves to become duller than when we have abundant rain.&nbsp; When we have more rain in the fall, the leaves tend to get knocked off the plants. This may shorten the fall color window.&nbsp; Fall leaf color will likely peak in about two weeks in the Midwest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s up with evergreens?</p>

<p>Evergreens are also preparing for winter and losing any needles that aren&#8217;t going to help them through the winter.&nbsp; This phenomenon that happens in the fall is called Needle Drop.&nbsp; Although evergreen don’t lose all their leaves in the fall, they do drop needles that are damaged or necessary. If all of the needles drop off the evergreen, you may have a disease problem that needs to be addressed. Or you may have a Bald Cypress or Larch. These trees lose all their needles every year. &nbsp;So, before you cut down that dead tree make sure it not a just dormant. I had a client once who had a beautiful bald cypress grove. Thinking they were dead trees because they moved to the property in winter. They had planned to cut all the &#8220;dead&#8221; trees down.  Luckily, they had sustained an injury and could not deal with the trees until spring. In spring, they discovered that their dead trees came back to life!</p>



<p>Evergreens have shallow roots and are very sensitive to environmental pressure like soil compaction and moisture.&nbsp; Too wet and the tree can drown, too dry and the tree can wither. Both conditions can lead to needle drop that is not normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why doesn&#8217;t all the leaves look beautiful?</p>



<p>Why are some trees and bushes so bright and other trees don&#8217;t have any color at all? Some trees or shrubs have various fungi and/or diseases on the leaves. If a plant has been battling a fungus or disease issue, it is common for the leaves to drop early. The leaves may also look brown or shriveled. The best course of action is to gather these early dropped leaves. You should compost them or get rid of them off your property. Sometimes diseases will show up at the end of the growing season. There is little reason for concern since the leaves will be dropping soon anyway. Tulip poplar trees in particular have powdery mildew on leaves. These will not hurt the tree and will be going away shortly.</p>



<p>Lumpy bumpy leaves</p>



<p> You may notice on the fallen leaves that there are bumps or growths on the leaves. These are usually no cause for concern. These are usually insects that have laid eggs on the leaf. The leaf has grown a structure around it called a Gall. The insects and the galls are harmless and you are witnessing part of the life cycle of that particular insect. Gall can also be produced if the plant has a particular disease. Most of the time the galls do not affect the health of the plant. They are a neat curiosity to see in the fall. </p>

<p>Why are the veins so green?</p>



<p>Red maples in the landscape can have a condition called interveinal chlorosis. This is where the veins are bright green, and the rest of the leaf is yellow. This commonly happens when they are showing a manganese deficiency due to too high of a soil pH. This condition can be corrected by lowering soil pH. Fall is a great time to soil test. </p>



<p>Fall is the best time to amend you soils for the coming year. Take a look at my article <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/blog/">Soil is not dirt</a>. for more information.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoy all that fall has to offer. Apple cider, pumpkins, and bonfires await you. Best of all are the fall colors.</p>

<p>As you harvest your vegetables have you noticed any UGV or unidentified growing Vegetables?</p>



<p><br>Does it look like aliens planted something to hatch in your garden? Maybe you&#8217;re wondering if your plants cross pollinated and you happen to get a Cucamelon or some sort of bizarre alien squash that was supposed to be a pumpkin but looks more like a Squashkin?  Are you wondering if you planted your zucchini too close to your melons or your pumpkin too close to your cucumbers? Did you end up with squashkins? Will planting cucumbers next to watermelons yield cucamelons?</p>



<p><br>No, it&#8217;s not likely that aliens have invaded and are planting our gardens with their grotesque spawn. In reality cucumbers and melons are not likely to cross-pollinate one another, so the answer is probably no. Plants of different species usually do not cross-pollinate in nature. Cross-pollination does frequently take place among some of the winter squash, pumpkins and gourds that are closely related. You would not see it this year with your current crop. It may happen with the seed collected from this year&#8217;s crop planted and grown next year.</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>Let&#8217;s discuss a little botany to explain. The fruit of any plant is actually a mature ovary, botanically speaking. The seed inside is similar to a child while the fruit is comparable to the mother. The seed, or child, has characteristics of both mother and father. The fruit on the other hand will look like the mother plant. In other words, if cross-pollination did take place, the seed, not the fruit, would be the result of that cross. The seed is a hybrid of the mother and father plants.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="255" height="223" data-attachment-id="191" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/09/27/unidentified-growing-vegetables-are-aliens-invading-your-garden/073rby37/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png" data-orig-size="255,223" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="073rby37" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" alt="" class="wp-image-191" style="width:406px;height:auto" srcset="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png 255w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></figure></div>


<p><br>The seed would have to be harvested, stored and planted the following year to determine if cross-pollination had an effect. Then, the resulting fruit on those plants might look like a combination of both parents. There are open pollinated varieties of vegetables that will always look like the parent plant. In my article Heirlooms vs Hybrid I go into more detail about the differences of open pollinated plants and hybrids.</p>



<p><br>If you do turn up some unexpectedly odd-looking fruits in your squash patch, it is possible that the seed packet contained a few seeds that were of questionable cross-bred parentage.  It happens sometimes, but most likely it is more likely that a &#8220;volunteer&#8221; squash from last year&#8217;s garden is the culprit. Sometimes these can be from the neighbor&#8217;s garden that a bird or another animal has brought into your garden. They&#8217;re not aliens but just a natural crossbred vegetable. The real question is can you eat it? The short answer is yes most of the time there are edible, that is not the same as if it tastes good. Many times, the taste you want is not the taste you get. Other times hybrid has superior taste. It&#8217;s all a matter of how the genetics of the parent plants worked out. Sometimes these Squashkins make some of the best Jack-o-lanterns so there is some use for those. As far as the cucamelons go, most likely they are an interesting oddity in your garden, and you can enjoy showing them off to friends and family. If you do see little green men in your garden, make sure they aren’t local children playing tricks on you otherwise you may want to call the government as those might just be aliens</p>
