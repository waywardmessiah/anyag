<p><strong>Home Greenhouses: A Guide to Extending Your Growing Season</strong></p>



<p>Greenhouses and cold frames are fantastic tools for any gardening enthusiast, offering opportunities to extend your growing season, start crops early, protect sensitive plants, and even grow year-round. These structures are perfect for getting your hands in the soil during colder months. For many, nurturing green, growing plants during the gray days of winter can bring a sense of hope and joy.</p>



<p>However, before you jump into owning a greenhouse, there are several important factors to consider. Thinking through these questions will help you choose the right greenhouse for your needs and ensure you’re prepared for this rewarding endeavor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Determining Your Purpose</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenline1/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg" data-orig-size="603,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GreenLine1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" width="603" height="477" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-1522" /></figure>



<p>Start by asking yourself: <strong>What’s the purpose of my greenhouse?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you want to grow year-round?</li>



<li>Are you cultivating orchids or other plants that require a temperature-controlled environment?</li>



<li>Do you need a head start on the growing season?</li>



<li>Is it part of a plan to expand your gardening operation for profit?</li>



<li>Are you look to grow fresh, off-season vegetables for your family?</li>



<li>Do you want a multi-functional structure that can serve different purposes?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re clear about how you’ll use the greenhouse, it’s time to dive deeper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Considerations</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do you have a suitable location?</strong> This is one of the most critical questions to address.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pay attention to how the sun’s position changes throughout the year, as this can affect light quality and intensity. Ensure your greenhouse gets adequate sunlight.</li>



<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> If possible, opt for an <strong>east-west orientation</strong> to distribute light evenly and maximize the winter sun. This setup is also better suited to handle prevailing winds, especially in windy regions.</li>



<li><img width="478" height="322" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3e5XMiFpB-oGcAKZcPKRvUQldjuI3IGZDDSX8IPZC5Lc1WtMK5hv5BrKxF1WvHKC321CekqeyRSjm31v5p-dpaumtuda22XUizK1bmz5c81Rk-IhP2E0CsCDXZgRDR-vFW8Pe?key=1k9zzEbJMXdDmcC7_JVjJhKn" alt="Sun Orentation1.gif"></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Before taking the plunge, take into account the following practical details:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Space:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient space and check for potential obstructions like trees and fences.</li>



<li><strong>Heating:</strong> Determine if you want a heat source you’ll use and budget for associated heating expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Consider local climate conditions, such as gray winter days, strong winds, snow fall and seasonal challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Slope and Drainage:</strong> Avoid placing your greenhouse at the bottom of a slope and ensure proper drainage to prevent water logging.  Also A greenhouse in a valley area will be colder then one that is on top of a hill. Cold air slides downhill. </li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Decide between automatic or manual ventilation to regulate temperature and humidity effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Electricity and Water:</strong> Ensure that your greenhouse has reliable access to electricity and water.</li>



<li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Plan for cooling solutions such as shade cloth, during summer months to prevent overheating.</li>



<li><strong>Zoning and Property Values:</strong> Check local ordinances for zoning regulations and consider how the greenhouse may impact neighborhood relations.</li>



<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Think about future needs—plan ahead for potential expansion as your gardening experience grows.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budget Planning</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1524" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/savings-2789137_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="savings-2789137_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1524" style="width:555px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p>When planning your project, the first question to ask yourself is, “How much am I willing to spend?” Setting a clear and realistic budget is crucial, as expenses can accumulate faster than anticipated. Beyond the initial costs, don’t overlook ongoing expenses such as electricity, water, and maintenance.  Recurring costs can significantly impact your long-term financial commitment.</p>



<p>While the allure of adding convenient features and premium upgrades may be tempting, staying within your budget ensures financial stability and prevents overspending. One smart strategy is to prioritize essential components first. Begin with a more basic setup that meets your immediate needs, and then enhance it gradually as resources allow. By pacing yourself, you’ll achieve a balance between functionality and affordability without compromising your financial goals.</p>



<p>Remember, a well-planned budget isn’t just about limiting spending—it’s about making the most of the resources you have while staying adaptable to future improvements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pests and Disease Management</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1526" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/aphid-5154237_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aphid-5154237_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1526" style="width:611px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p><strong>What’s your plan for managing pests and diseases?</strong> All greenhouses face these challenges eventually. Consider whether you’ll pursue organic methods and prepare a strategy to address these issues effectively. Learn to implement IPM.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong></h4>



<p>Integrated Pest Management combines multiple methods to create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to pest and disease control. IPM focuses on prevention, monitoring, and targeted interventions to minimize chemical use and maintain a healthy greenhouse ecosystem.</p>



<p>By implementing these strategies, you can maintain a thriving greenhouse environment and keep your plants healthy year-round. Let me know if you&#8217;d like me to expand further or focus on any specific pest or disease issue!</p>



<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in greenhouses is a strategic and environmentally conscious approach to pest control. It involves a combination of practices to manage pests effectively while minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Key components of IPM include regular monitoring of pest populations, accurate identification of pests, and the use of biological control agents such as beneficial insects or microorganisms. Cultural practices like maintaining optimal environmental conditions and sanitizing greenhouse spaces also play a vital role in preventing pest outbreaks. By integrating these methods, greenhouse growers can ensure sustainable pest management that protects crops, reduces chemical residues, and supports a healthier ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants to thrive, but they can also create a favorable setting for pests and diseases to multiply. The warm, humid conditions that benefit your plants may also attract unwanted visitors like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, or fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew and botrytis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Is Key</strong></h4>



<p>Taking proactive measures can help reduce the likelihood of outbreaks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep your greenhouse clean by removing plant debris and regularly disinfecting tools, pots, and surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Quarantine New Plants:</strong> Inspect and isolate new plants before introducing them to the greenhouse.</li>



<li><strong>Healthy Plants:</strong> Maintain proper care for plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure adequate airflow to prevent humidity from reaching levels that encourage fungal growth.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection</strong></h4>



<p>Constant vigilance is crucial for catching problems before they escalate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check plants frequently for signs of pests like holes, discoloration, sticky residue, or webbing.</li>



<li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Use yellow or blue sticky traps to monitor flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.</li>



<li><strong>Soil Checks:</strong> Periodically inspect soil for pests like fungus gnats or root-knot nematodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Control Methods</strong></h4>



<p>If issues arise, there are several ways to address them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewings, or predatory mites, to combat pests naturally.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Sprays:</strong> Use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or horticultural oils, to manage pests without harmful chemicals.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Rotate crops, avoid overcrowding, and remove infected plants promptly to limit the spread of diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> As a last resort, apply pesticides or fungicides, ensuring they are appropriate for the problem and safe for use in greenhouses. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disease-Specific Tips</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Prevent fungal issues by controlling humidity levels and avoiding overhead watering.</li>



<li><strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Avoid working with plants when they’re wet, as this can spread bacterial pathogens.</li>



<li><strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Viruses are often spread by pests like aphids. Manage pest populations to reduce the risk of viral transmission.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing Setup</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1528" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenhouse-827464_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="greenhouse-827464_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" /></figure>



<p>Think about the logistics of your greenhouse:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planting Methods:</strong> Will you grow directly in the ground, in raised beds, or on tables?</li>



<li><strong>Nutrient Delivery:</strong> How will you provide nutrients to your plants? Have a clear plan for their care and growth.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting Small</strong></h3>

<p>New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5p6DIlO6g&amp;t=1s">YouTube Video on my about cold frames</a>!!  Check it out!!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to have fresh vegetables after your garden has finished. &nbsp; It feels great to thwart the natural ending to the growing session and continue to grow vegetables for your family. Using cold frames and row covers to extend your growing season is one easy solution. The best part is, that it&#8217;s not hard to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are affiliate links it this article</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cold Frames</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m never ready for the end of the growing season.  Frost seems to come out of nowhere and kill the growing season. Cold frames are great for protecting plants from frost. Planting cold season crops in a cold frame helps with the &#8220;Growing Seasons Over&#8221; blues.  The growing seasons not over, not yet, not if you have a cold frame. &nbsp; Garden fresh vegetables in late fall early winter is amazing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z+wLj6aAL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Giantex Wood Cold Frame, Mini Garden Greenhouse, Transparent Flip Top Lid, Bottomless Planter Raised Bed for Vegetable and Flowers, Indoor and Outdoor Patio&#8230; <br><a href="https://amzn.to/410nafS">https://amzn.to/410nafS</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cold frames are also great for getting ready for the growing season.&nbsp; They warm the soil up early. This allows seed planting to happen several weeks early. Giving you a jump on the growing season. Cold frames are great at protecting young plants from late frosts in the spring. Having a few extra weeks of growth can get your garden off to a great start. &nbsp; Cold frames create a humid environment that encourages plant growth and produces bigger plants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a cold frame?</h3>



<p></p>



<p>A cold frame is essentially a box with a transparent cover.&nbsp; This box acts as a small greenhouse for your plants. They protect plants from the elements, especially frost, wind and cold temperatures.&nbsp; A micro-climate&nbsp;is created using solar energy and the ground as insulation. They are great for starting plants in the spring and growing cold tolerant plants in the fall.&nbsp; They can also be used to overwinter dormant plants. The cold frames usually stay a bit warmer throughout the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware you have made a little greenhouse, and these little greenhouses can get quite warm with good sunshine. It is not uncommon for them to get above 90-degree F.&nbsp; High temperatures can damage young seedling.&nbsp; Getting a thermometer to monitor the temperature will help avoid any unfortunate seedling death. &nbsp;Cold season plants such as cabbage, radish and lettuce need cooler temps to grow well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Venting the cold frame when it is reaching higher temperature is necessary. &nbsp; </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watering</h3>



<p> Don&#8217;t forget to water the plants in your cold frames.&nbsp; Active plant growth will use water and can quickly dry the soil out.&nbsp; You may not need as much water as you would in the summer months. It is a good idea to watch the plants and make sure they have enough water.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hardening off your Seedlings</h3>



<p>For those who don’t know, hardening off seedlings is the process of acclimatizing them to the outside temperatures. It&#8217;s hard on seedlings that have been in a warm and moist environment to adjust to the outside weather.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hardening off is important. If seedlings are shocked, it can kill them or stunt their growth.  Start by gradually exposing the seedling to the outdoors. Leave your cold frame open for longer periods. Do this repeatedly over a couple of weeks.&nbsp; You can move plants into a shaded area to help the hardening off process. Then move them back to the cold frame to help them harden off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cold frames are great for the DIY person. They are relatively simple to make and easy to use.&nbsp; Most of the time you can use materials you have on hand or can scavenge.&nbsp; Recycled materials for cold frames is a wonderful way to help the waste. &nbsp; The basic set up is a bottomless box with a piece of something&nbsp;clear to let the sun in.&nbsp; They can be as easy as placing a straw bale around your plants with a glass door on top. Alternatively, they can be a complicated woodworking project with an automatic opener and all the bells and whistles. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and Tricks to Cold Frames</h3>



<p>Insulating the box will help extend the season. Use insulation or bubble wrap or just some straw. &nbsp; This help eliminated any drafts</p>



<p>The cover doesn&#8217;t have to be totally clear. It has to let most of the light in. It can be a semitransparent film or poly carbonate.</p>



<p>Face your cold frame south.  This will capture the most sunlight. Winter sunlight can be weak but facing south makes the most of the sun that is available.&nbsp; Winter sun is on a different angle than summer sun. Utilize all the sunlight, as it is most beneficial to your plant.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bells and Whistles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can buy cold frames online if you are not a confident DIY person. They are nice option. They are quicker to get working. There is everything thing from your basic cold frame to deluxe models with nice bells and whistles.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8211; Kits have all the pieces and directions to help you build the cold frame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Kits sometimes come with automatic openers. These are great for hands-free ventilation of the cold frame. They work when it gets too warm then opens to allow the heat to escape. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Kits can have added insulation to the box will help remove drafts and help keep it warmer.</p>



<p>-Kits generally are made from a rot and disease resistant materials like plastic or treated wood to ensure a long-lasting cold frame</p>

<p>You can insulate with almost anything. Straw bales work great. Bubble wrap and reflective insulation work great too. Insulation can also remove drafts. However fiberglass insulation can be problematic. Animals like to nest in it. It can get all over if not contained and sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&#8211; DIY Using Plastic Wood</strong></p>



<p>This is a bit harder. You can protect your box with paint to help resist water. Alternatively, using scraps of plastic wood from another project is a great idea. Use recycled plastic wood to maximize the benefit to your project and the environment.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; DIY Using Ground Cloth</strong></p>



<p>A DIY ground cloth. Using cardboard on the ground and some mulch will help insulate your box as well as help keep the heat.&nbsp; Using dark mulch will help with warming the box.</p>



<p><strong>-DIY Heat Coils</strong></p>

<p>I have seen people use outdoor Christmas light nets to increase the heat bed of seedling trays. They would have to be tradition lights, not LED because LED don’t get warm enough.  You would need to make sure  the lights are in good working order.&nbsp; You need to check them daily for damage.&nbsp; Also, this is not a solution to be done for a long time. It will work great for a few weeks to start seedlings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have built several cold frames over the years.&nbsp; Almost all have been from material that have been laying around.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. &nbsp; I have a quick and dirty video that will be posted soon.&nbsp; I hope you will share some of your DIY cold frames.&nbsp; I would love to see the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a good website about cold frame from the University of Iowa.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/yard-and-garden-all-about-cold-frames">Yard and Garden: All about Cold Frames | News</a></p>



<p>What about Row Covers?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about Row Covers?</h2>



<p>&nbsp; Row covers are an excellent for season extension. A row cover is a blanket usually made of spun poly material. It can protect plants from frosts and pests.&nbsp; These are temporarily installed to help enhance plant growth during the spring or fall by increasing temperature and humidity.&nbsp; Row covers can give 2-7 degrees F of frost protection.&nbsp; Row Covers also can protect a crop from insect pests.&nbsp; They are a temporary measure and usually gives a grower 4-6 weeks of extended growth. &nbsp; A row cover also gives wind protection to young plants.&nbsp; Most row covers can be reused for 2-3 years. &nbsp; The are relatively inexpensive choice for season extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619hG5NJ4ZL._AC_SL1001_.jpg" alt="" style="width:372px;height:auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Plant Covers Freeze Protection 10 ft x 30 ft Floating Row Cover 0.9oz/yd² Garden Fabric Plant Cover for Winter Frost/Sun Pest Protection (10FT X 30FT)  <a href="https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH">https://amzn.to/4i3A2YH</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What the row cover is made of can make a difference. Most commonly it is a spun poly-synthetic material. &nbsp; It feels a bit like gauze.&nbsp; This material allows for air flow and water to filter though. &nbsp; The type of row cover you use will decide how much protection you will have.&nbsp; Generally, there are three weights of row covers.&nbsp; Light, medium and heavy weight fabric.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Light weight is best for insect barriers. They also have great light transmittance. upwards of 90%&nbsp;It protects against light frosts. </p>



<p>&#8211; Medium weight is best for frost protection for spring and fall crops. Medium will give about 4-6 degrees of frost protection and has about 85% light penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;-Heavy weight is best for heavy frost and over wintering of plants. The light penetration for heavy weight is about 50%</p>



<p>Row covers have one great advantage. They are useful when you want to cover already established plants like strawberry or raspberries. They are also helpful for garden plants.&nbsp;It is relatively easy to add row cover over an established plant and can extend your harvest. &nbsp; Depending on the crops, just put the cover over the crop and secure it with staples or bricks. For taller plants, the row covers can be supported by PVC or wire bows to make a tunnel.&nbsp; Make sure the ends are secured from wind and animals</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages or row covers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Weeding under a row cover can be problematic and may require pulling the row cover off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-If you grow a crop that relies on pollinators, a row crop may hinder pollination. You should pull it back to allow for adequate pollination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8211; It also can be time consuming to pull row covers off. This is especially challenging in windy conditions.</p>

<p>&#8211; Mice love to nest in row cover in the off season. You will need to store the row covers in a mouse proof box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Severe weather can tear and rip up a row cover.</p>



<p>&#8211; The row crop material can also tear on stems or plants during windy conditions</p>



<p>&#8211; In some areas, recycling the row cover is problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Row cover are a great addition to your cold frames.&nbsp; Both of these tools can be used to increase you harvest and lengthen you growing season.&nbsp; I would love to see how you are use these tools in you garden and homestead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More information about row covers here are two great websites.&nbsp; They have great information.&nbsp; Enjoy!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Winter is setting in. The weather has gotten colder. For many of us, there is still plenty to do, especially if you have animals. In this newsletter, you will get some timely information about the plants and animals in your care.   There is still plenty of plant to take care of this season. Christmas trees, holly, Christmas cactus, amaryllis and cyclamen all have a special place during the holidays. Still a lot to do on the homestead too. Don&#8217;t forget to protect your trees and shrubs from salt and heavy snow.  Take care of your animal&#8217;s needs by exploring all the different ways to keep water from freezing.</p>

<p><strong>Christmas Trees</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>&nbsp; Keeping your fresh Christmas tree safe by making sure you are watering enough.&nbsp; A cut Christmas tree can go through a quart of water for every inch in diameter. For example, a 7-foot tree with a 3–4-inch trunk can use 3-4 quarts of water a day. That&#8217;s around a gallon! I have a whole blog post that just came out on Christmas trees and their care. Take a look at last week&#8217;s blog post on Christmas trees. <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/11/08/why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/">Why-choose-a-real-christmas-tree-this-holiday/</a></p>

<p><strong>Fresh Greenery</strong></p>



<p>Now is a great time to trim evergreens for fresh holiday greenery.&nbsp; Spruce, pine and hollies make great holiday greenery because it smells great and is biodegradable. &nbsp; Winter is a perfect season to trim evergreens. There is less insects and diseases in winter, so the plants have time to heal. </p>



<p><strong>Holly</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" data-attachment-id="498" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/11/15/winter-care-tips-for-your-homestead/holly/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="holly" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=750" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-498" srcset="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=150 150w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg?w=768 768w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holly.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Holly greenery is always popular for the holidays.&nbsp; The red berries and glossy leaves make this a particularly beautiful plant for your holidays.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have any red berries, you may have a male plant. You need to plant a female plant to get those berries.&nbsp; When trimming for greenery, put the ends in water until they are needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Caring for Other Christmas Plants like Amaryllis and Cyclamen&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For anyone who loves plants, amaryllis bulbs and cyclamen are a wonderful gift. Giving something that is green and blooming can lift the spirit of any scrooge. These plants have become popular to have during the holiday season as alternative to poinsettias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amaryllis bulbs grow tall with large blooms. They are a really gorgeous plant to have as a centerpiece for the holidays. They seem to grow with little care. If you have Amaryllis from last year, it should start growing for the next bloom cycle. After the flower is spent make sure the flower is completely yellowed, then cut the stalk. Make sure it is in a sunny place. This ensures the leaves can still get enough sun. The bulb needs to store enough nutrients to bloom again. Be aware that amaryllis is toxic to cats and dogs</p>

<p>Cyclamens have such beautiful lasting color when the winter can be very dull and gray. Cyclamen plants prefer cool temps to bloom and grow. Temperatures between 60-65 Degrees F. &nbsp; They require indirect sunlight to bloom.&nbsp; This plant is a tender perennial and goes dormant during the summer. It is commonly grown as a houseplant and the unique foliage is enjoyed until it goes dormant.&nbsp; Cyclamen is toxic to pets so keep your plant protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Christmas Cactus</strong></p>



<p>Reblooming Christmas and Thanksgiving Cacti Christmas Cactus and Thanksgiving Cactus  are popular flowering holiday plants.  Christmas cactus normally has smooth stem segments.&nbsp;Thanksgiving Cactus has hook-like appendages on each segment.  </p>



<p>Flowering will not occur unless induced by temperature and/or light treatment. If the temperature is held at 50 to 55 degrees F, flowering will occur regardless of day length. But flowering usually is not uniform. Temperatures below 50 degrees F prevent flowering. Nights greater than 12 hours long and temperatures between 59 and 69 degrees also can generate flowers. Twenty-five consecutive long nights is enough for flower initiation. It takes an additional nine to 10 weeks for flowers to complete development and bloom.</p>

<p>Both of these cacti like bright indirect light. Too much sun may cause leaves to turn yellow. Common household temperatures are fine. Keep soil constantly moist but not waterlogged. These plants seem to flower best if kept a little pot bound. If you need to repot you cactus, wait until spring.</p>

<p><strong>House Plants</strong></p>



<p>House plants that you brought in from outside should be getting used to being inside.&nbsp; Make sure they are not getting over watered as their growth will slow down in the winter months</p>



<p>&nbsp;Check for brown or dry edges. This indicates that the plant would do well with some more humidity.&nbsp; This can be done with a cold mist humidifier, pebble trays or grouping plants together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Houseplants in this time of year may not get enough light because the days are short and gray.&nbsp; Keep the plant away from cold windows as the foliage may die. &nbsp; Adding a supplemental light source until the days start getting longer will help the plants maintain their foliage</p>



<p><strong>Forcing Bulbs</strong></p>



<p>Remember the bulbs you put in the refrigerator last month? This month is great for forcing bulbs and getting that amazing pop of color in the winter.&nbsp; If you forgot to get your bulbs in the cooler, buy pre-chilled bulbs. Forced bulbs make a great gift to give other gardeners or anyone who misses being outdoors when it&#8217;s cold. &nbsp; The bulbs needs to be planted in moist soils and put in a warm bright place. They should bloom in 2-4 weeks depending on variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Things To Do In The Yard</strong></p>



<p>Cabin fever has got the best of you. There are a few tasks you can do outside. These tasks will improve your yard and your mood giving you a jump start on spring.</p>



<p><strong>Salt and Snow Melt</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Avoid using sodium chloride to melt snow and ice on your driveway or sidewalks. This causes damage to the plants in the adjacent areas and can damage any brick work too.&nbsp; Use something safer like potassium chloride or calcium chloride.&nbsp; Better yet, use sand or kitty litter for traction on slick surfaces. This can always be swept up in the spring and won&#8217;t harm your plants.  It can save you a little money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Its Not To Late to Mulch</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you have mulch in your planting beds. Putting a thick layer of straw over root crops protects them. Mulching allows the crops to be harvested all winter long. You can harvest them a little at a time without having to store them inside. &nbsp; This works great with parsnips, carrots, leeks, and beets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check young and thin barked trees for splitting. Last month we talked about wrapping these trees with a tree wrap to prevent it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recommend using paint of any sort. Paint prevents the tree from getting adequate air to the trunk. Additionally, it can attract insects in the spring. &nbsp; Pay attention to south and southwest facing sides of the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;If cracking is happening, wrap those tree trunks now. This will give the plant a chance to heal the damage before spring. Make sure that you remove the wrapping just before the spring thaw. This ensures moisture isn&#8217;t being caught, causing rotting in the wound.</p>

<p>Look at your landscape&#8217;s broad leaves evergreen plants and evergreen trees. These could be your azalea, rhododendron or boxwood plants. Be on the watch for the leaves turning brown. This can happen due to excessive drying from the wind. If you have a particularly windy place in your landscape, protect those tender plants. Use burlap on the south and west sides to shield them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Salt Spray</strong></p>



<p>Be aware of salt spray from the street. This can cause a lot of damage to your landscape. If you notice salt spray, protect those plants with burlap. Polyethylene plant screens are also a good.&nbsp;&nbsp; White pines, cedars, boxwood and other evergreens are very sensitive to salt spray. These plants will have a difficult time in high traffic areas where salt and snow melt have occurred.  If salt spray is damaging a plant in your landscape, consider removing the plant and replace it in the spring.</p>

<p>Avoid shoveling any snow on shrubs or trees especially if it has salt or snow melt in it. &nbsp;This prevents winter burn of shrubs and keep them healthy.&nbsp;Shoveling snow can break branches and damage the shape of the shrubs too. Be aware of snowplows piling up snow. </p>



<p><strong>Garden Chemicals and Fertilizers</strong></p>



<p>Garden chemicals are sensitive to cold and freezing. This includes sprays liquid and fertilizers. Even if you are an organic gardener.&nbsp; Be sure you have them stored in a secure place that doesn&#8217;t freeze. Freezing can make the product unusable in spring. Inspect containers to make sure their labels are intact.  </p>

<p>Check any produce or tender bulbs in storage.&nbsp; It could be your dahlias or begonia tubers or potatoes. Throw out any bulbs that are molding, softening or shriveling.&nbsp; If you see several bulbs shriveling this indicates there isn&#8217;t enough humidity. You will need to add some humidity to preserve your harvest. One way to do this is to run a humidifier part of time.

<p><strong>Care and Feeding of Your Compost Pile</strong></p>



<p>Turn your compost pile to ensure it is warm enough to destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Turning your compost pile encourages it to break down. turning in to wonderful compost for next years garden. &nbsp; If your compost pile is not warm enough make sure to add more green items like kitchen scraps. Make sure you are adding to your compost pile, so it is ready for spring. Good compost is the secret to a great garden.</p>



<p><strong>Frost Heaves</strong></p>



<p>Check for frost heaving. Frost heaving when the ground thaws and freezes. This can cause shallow rooted perennials to lift out of the ground. Indiana has a lot of these freeze-thaw cycles. If you discovered roots that have been pushed out of the ground gently push the roots back into the soil. If the soil is too frozen to put the roots back, cover roots with 3-4 inches of mulch. This should protect the roots until a thaw cycle to put the roots back underground.</p>

<p>By now you are probably had to deal with frozen water. Frozen livestock water is the bane of almost all animal farmers. It doesn&#8217;t matter, chickens to cattle everyone deals with frozen water sometimes. There are hundreds of &#8220;tried and true &#8221; ways to keep your water open. There are a lot of homemade DIY solutions, and some may work for you. Each farm is unique, and some work better than others. The following are the main ways that water is kept open for livestock. Let me know what works for you. I would love to see your ideas. Lets explore: electric heaters, nesting tanks, heated hoses, insulated buckets, solar options, composting, freeze miser, propane heaters, constant water flow and pop bottles with salt.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are many types of electric heaters out on the market for every type of animal. These can range from being pretty inexpensive to very expensive. Some have many bells and whistles to ensure your water is open and animals are safe. The biggest drawback to electric waters is the need of having electricity run to where your water is needed. This can get complicated when you have multiple waters to run. Running extension cords can be dangerous if they are not rated for wet areas. Animals can chew on the cords becoming a shock risk. It&#8217;s a good idea to have an electrician check your electricity. Ensure your circuits can handle the extra load and have not been damaged over the summer. Barn fires happen all the time, most are caused by electrical issues. This extra step can save you thousands of dollars and a world heartache.</li>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t already brought your houseplants, now is the time. House plants that have been on the porch should have been protected enough from light frost. They should have been in a protected location. Houseplants that have been outside and just brought indoors will benefit from a trim. This trimming lessens the amount of foliage that will inevitably wilt and die.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal for houseplants to feel a little shocked when they return indoors after being outside all summer. &nbsp;Your houseplants will slow growing and will need less water and fertilizer.&nbsp; With leaf drop happening it is very easy to over water your indoor plants.&nbsp; You may need to move your houseplant to the sunniest areas. Add supplemental lighting if the leaf drop is becoming a mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Potting up Spring Flower Bulbs to Force Indoors in Mid Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Pot up spring flower bulbs such as daffodils and paper whites pot them up so just the tips are exposed.&nbsp; Then refrigerate for 10-13 weeks.&nbsp; After the cold period, put in a sunny location and allow it to grow. Blooms should happen in 3-4 weeks after putting them in sunny location. &nbsp; You will thank me later in the winter if you do this now.&nbsp; Also, you can just put the bulbs in the refrigerator and pot up in 10-13 weeks. It may take a little longer for the bulbs to bloom since they need to grow root system.</p>

<p>Put poinsettias in complete darkness from 5 pm to 8 am daily until early December. This routine will force the red (or other color) bracts to show. Once the leaves start to show color, you may bring them out of their dark routine.  A bract is the color that is shown on the leaves giving the poinsettia is colors. </p>



<p><strong>Outdoors, Things to Get Done.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of any really nice November days. Use this time to work on some outdoor tasks before you put up your Christmas lights. It will save yourself a ton of time, energy and work if you do some simple thing to get ready for winter</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Rodent Damage to Trees</strong></p>



<p>Prevent rabbit and rodent damage on trees by putting up physical barriers around trunks by using hardware cloth.&nbsp; The hardware cloth must be ¼ inch or less to be effective. Chicken wire is not going to help you out and it can be frustrating to work with.&nbsp; Chemical repellents are going to be less effective, are always temporary, expensive and not always foolproof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Young Trees Need Care Before Winter</strong></p>
