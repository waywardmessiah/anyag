<p>Jack-O-Lantern</p>



<p>The tradition of carving pumpkin dates back for many centuries. The people of Ireland and Scotland used to carve scary faces in to turnips and Potatoes. They did this to deter evil spirits from entering their homes. In England they sometime used large beets to Jack-o-Lanterns. When immigrating came to America, they brought this tradition with them but found a more suitable native fruit, the pumpkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be surprised to learn that they are over 50 verities of pumpkins.&nbsp; There is a lot of research done by university to attempt to improve the quality of the pumpkin for production. Some improvement to pumpkins are rot resistance. Another way breeding programs improved pumpkin quality was to strengthen the Handle or connection point of the vine to the pumpkin so they stay connected.  </p>



<p>Selecting a pumpkin can be a challenge.&nbsp; You always want to select a ripe pumpkin. Select a pumpkin&nbsp;that has no bruises or soft spots. These bruises or soft spots may be signs of the pumpkin starting to spoil. It may not last until you use the pumpkin.&nbsp;Store the pumpkins in a cool dry place where there is enough space between pumpkins to allow air to circulate.&nbsp; This will help prevent bruising of the flesh.&nbsp; On bad spot on a pumpkin can affect the others. &nbsp; You never want to carry a pumpkin by the stem.&nbsp; The stem can easily brake and you may wind up with a squash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When picking pumpkins to eat, you may be better off with smaller pie pumpkins. These pumpkins  have better flavor and less water than really big pumpkins. Also, if you intend to eat you pumpkin it is best not to carve it.&nbsp;Decorating it with paint or stickers  is a creative way to make you smaller pie pumpkins even more festive. </p>



<p>Carving jack o lanterns is a tradition for this time of the year.&nbsp; When you are planning to carve with children please make&nbsp; sure there is adult supervision.&nbsp; For small children it may be better to allows them to decorate their pumpkins with stickers, paints or markers.&nbsp; There are many creative ideas that can be done to decorate a pumpkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When carving it is best to carve it the same day you intend to use it.&nbsp; However you can carve a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Make sure to cover it in cling wrap .&nbsp; Cover the lid and place it back in the pumpkin, makes sure there is a layer of plastic between the lid and the ledge.&nbsp; Cover the whole pumpkin in plastic covering the carvings and place in the refrigerator.&nbsp; Be sure not to freeze the pumpkin it will turn in to a mushy mess.&nbsp; If you need to restore a shriveling pumpkin soak it for 2-6 hours .Be careful not to over soak it because the pumpkin can crack.&nbsp; Vaseline or vegetable oil spread on the cult edges can help make you carving last longer be sealing in the moisture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many tools out there to help carve pumpkins. Many of them have safely feature to help prevent injuries. If you use a kitchen knife make sure it is very sharp. The pumpkin skins are very hard to get thought and adult help is needed. When cutting into the pumpkin to gut it try cutting it out on the bottom. A cut on the bottom can help the pumpkin sit securely on a surface. It is easier to take the insides out. You can make a tasty snack by roasting the seeds of the pumpkin. Scrap the edges so they are about 1 inch thick. Any thicker and it may be difficult to carve into, any thinner and the carving may loose its shape. Pumpkin carving is a lot of fun and can bring the whole family together. If you take safety precautions everyone can have a safe and fun holiday. </p>



<p>After you have finished make sure to save the seed and make a delicious snack. On my recipes page you can get a quick tried and true recipe for <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/favorite-recipes/">roasting pumpkin seeds</a>.</p>

<p>Should one grow Heirloom or Hybrid plants? This is a discussion that keeps coming up between local gardeners and horticulture professionals. There is a lot of confusion about both types of plants. Heirloom plants can be defined in many ways, but there are some characteristics that many of the definitions share.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are always open pollinated.&nbsp; This means that the seeds from this year’s plants will grow to be just like that of the parent plant.&nbsp; That true-to-seed characteristic makes Heirloom seeds able to be harvested and saved year after year.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are usually varieties that have been around for a long period of time. Some believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been around for longer than 50 years.&nbsp; This period of time can vary depending on who you talk to.&nbsp; Some people believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been handed down over generations of seed savers; they feel that Heirloom plants are a part of their cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hybrid Advantages</strong></p>



<p>Hybrid plants&nbsp; are developed by taking two different plants and cross pollinating them to try to create a better plant. For example, scientists may take two different tomato plants, one that has big fruit and one that is disease resistant. These two plants are cross- pollinated in hopes that the resulting offspring may be a plant that has big fruit and is also disease resistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Heirloom Advantages</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Heirloom plants is that they are known for excellent flavor, color, or fragrances.&nbsp; Heirloom plants come in a large variety of shapes and sizes which are fun to have in the garden.&nbsp; They have a strong cultural connection for many gardeners.&nbsp; However, Heirloom plants also have some disadvantages. They can be less hardy or disease resistant.&nbsp; Some seeds may take a longer time to germinate. The germination rates for Heirloom seeds may be low or erratic. &nbsp; The growth habit of Heirloom seeds can seem wild or unruly. &nbsp; Heirloom plants may not produce as many fruits or flowers as hybridized plants. They can also have traits that are undesirable such as thorns or ugly fruit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Hybrid plants is that they are very dependable for producing flowers or fruits. &nbsp; They tend to produce more fruits or flowers.&nbsp; They generally have better and faster germination rates than Heirloom plants. Some Hybrid vegetables will produce all at once so it is easier to predict when the crop is ready to be harvested. Hybrid plants also have a more predictable growth habit.&nbsp; One of the big disadvantages of Hybrid plants is that sometimes one trait is sacrificed for another, for example, flavor is sacrificed for disease resistance.&nbsp; Also, if you find a plant that you really like you will have to buy new seeds year after year.&nbsp; Hybrid plants may also cost more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most gardeners raise a combination of Heirloom and Hybrid plants, desiring traits from both types. Because there are so many exceptional varieties of both Heirloom and Hybrid plants it is worth experimenting with growing both types to decide what works best for you.&nbsp; Part of the fun is looking around at all the beautiful tomatoes that are in the garden right now and determining which one you would like to grow next year.&nbsp; Make sure you take notes in your garden journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been growing for Tomatoes for year and I like to plant a variety of tomatoes. I love to grow Heirlooms for eating fresh and love to grow hybrids for cooking and canning. Let me know what your preference. </p>
