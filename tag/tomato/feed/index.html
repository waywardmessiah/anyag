<p>Should one grow Heirloom or Hybrid plants? This is a discussion that keeps coming up between local gardeners and horticulture professionals. There is a lot of confusion about both types of plants. Heirloom plants can be defined in many ways, but there are some characteristics that many of the definitions share.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are always open pollinated.&nbsp; This means that the seeds from this year’s plants will grow to be just like that of the parent plant.&nbsp; That true-to-seed characteristic makes Heirloom seeds able to be harvested and saved year after year.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are usually varieties that have been around for a long period of time. Some believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been around for longer than 50 years.&nbsp; This period of time can vary depending on who you talk to.&nbsp; Some people believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been handed down over generations of seed savers; they feel that Heirloom plants are a part of their cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hybrid Advantages</strong></p>



<p>Hybrid plants&nbsp; are developed by taking two different plants and cross pollinating them to try to create a better plant. For example, scientists may take two different tomato plants, one that has big fruit and one that is disease resistant. These two plants are cross- pollinated in hopes that the resulting offspring may be a plant that has big fruit and is also disease resistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Heirloom Advantages</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Heirloom plants is that they are known for excellent flavor, color, or fragrances.&nbsp; Heirloom plants come in a large variety of shapes and sizes which are fun to have in the garden.&nbsp; They have a strong cultural connection for many gardeners.&nbsp; However, Heirloom plants also have some disadvantages. They can be less hardy or disease resistant.&nbsp; Some seeds may take a longer time to germinate. The germination rates for Heirloom seeds may be low or erratic. &nbsp; The growth habit of Heirloom seeds can seem wild or unruly. &nbsp; Heirloom plants may not produce as many fruits or flowers as hybridized plants. They can also have traits that are undesirable such as thorns or ugly fruit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Hybrid plants is that they are very dependable for producing flowers or fruits. &nbsp; They tend to produce more fruits or flowers.&nbsp; They generally have better and faster germination rates than Heirloom plants. Some Hybrid vegetables will produce all at once so it is easier to predict when the crop is ready to be harvested. Hybrid plants also have a more predictable growth habit.&nbsp; One of the big disadvantages of Hybrid plants is that sometimes one trait is sacrificed for another, for example, flavor is sacrificed for disease resistance.&nbsp; Also, if you find a plant that you really like you will have to buy new seeds year after year.&nbsp; Hybrid plants may also cost more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most gardeners raise a combination of Heirloom and Hybrid plants, desiring traits from both types. Because there are so many exceptional varieties of both Heirloom and Hybrid plants it is worth experimenting with growing both types to decide what works best for you.&nbsp; Part of the fun is looking around at all the beautiful tomatoes that are in the garden right now and determining which one you would like to grow next year.&nbsp; Make sure you take notes in your garden journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been growing for Tomatoes for year and I like to plant a variety of tomatoes. I love to grow Heirlooms for eating fresh and love to grow hybrids for cooking and canning. Let me know what your preference. </p>
