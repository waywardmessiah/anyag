<p><strong>The Real Deal</strong></p>



<p>&#8216;Tis the season for real Christmas trees!&nbsp;  Personally, I love having a real tree in my house for the Christmas season.&nbsp; A real tree brings the smell and feeling of the holidays home.   I love going to my local Christmas tree farm and picking out a tree with my kids.  Then, warming up with a hot chocolate to warm up after a wonderful day out.  I&#8217;m not alone  &nbsp; Over 35 million Americans bring real Christmas trees into their homes as part of the holiday celebration.&nbsp; Did you know that a real Christmas tree is environmentally and economically sound choice for the holidays? Real Christmas trees help the support forest and wildlife habitat too. </p>

<p>Most of the real Christmas trees that are for sale are from family-owned tree farms.&nbsp; These trees are raised to be the centerpiece decorations for many families.&nbsp;Real trees don’t require the intensive carbon emissions that it takes to produce and ship artificial trees.  They can decompose and don&#8217;t need to go to a landfill.  A real Christmas tree is a recyclable and renewable resource that can be useful after the holiday season too.&nbsp; These trees can be turned into mulch, firewood, and fish and wildlife habitat. Many communities and tree farms offer a recycling program for your tree after the holidays are over.&nbsp; Contact your local parks or street department for local tree recycling programs.  You can be proud that you helped support small farms in your area. When you purchase a tree from a Christmas tree farm, you keep your money local. You also help a family maintain their farm and small business.&nbsp;One of the best benefits is you don’t have to put the tree away after the holidays are over</p>



<p><strong>Supporting Forests.</strong></p>

<p>You’re supporting forests too. When natural trees are harvested for sale, there are more than ten times as many trees left standing! According to the Nature Conservancy, out of the 350-500 million growing on tree farms across the U.S., only 30 million trees are harvested for Christmas each year. Growing Christmas trees takes up to 10 years and there always some growing for the next year. This ensures the land is covered by trees , reducing erosion and creating animal habitats. Buying real Christmas trees help keep farms in business. They will also ensure their lands remains covered in the healthy forest habitat.   Real Christmas trees are a real Win-Win situation for everyone involved.</p>



<p><strong>Real Christmas Tree Farm Dos and Don’ts</strong></p>

<p>One of my favorite things to do is go to a Christmas tree farm to pick out a fresh tree. Christmas tree operations can be as simple as having a lot of trees.Or can also be a full-blown holiday wonderland with lots of things to do for the family. </p>



<p></p>



<p>&nbsp; <strong> DOs and DON’T</strong>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>DO </strong>bring a pair of gloves. Leather or thick gloves for handling the tree will save you a lot of time and frustration. Being able to handle the tree when cutting it will help you make a better cut and increase your comfort. </li>



<li><strong>DO</strong> Bring a blanket or tarp to protect your vehicle. When haling a tree home, it is helpful to have a blanket or tarp. Wrap your tree in it to get it home. This protects its needles from wind and your car scratches.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>DO</strong> make every effort to cut it off near the ground.&nbsp; This sounds like common sense. I have often seen trees cut off from a foot to halfway up. Families did this because they didn&#8217;t need all of the tree.&nbsp; This poses a problem for the Christmas tree farm. You will be charged for the whole tree in most cases anyway. This increases the prices. Now, they need someone to cut off the tree at the ground. They also have to take care of the waste.&nbsp; The leftover parts of the tree can become a tripping hazard to other people looking for a tree. Most operators of Christmas tree farms find it rude behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time these operations are family run businesses, and they have chosen to share their holidays with you.&nbsp;So, a little respect goes a long way. It costs you nothing to be kind and courteous. &nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>DO</strong> respect their properties.&nbsp;  These operators have invited you to their farms to share in holidays.  Respect their signs and boundaries.  This is for your safety and theirs.    &nbsp;Often Christmas tree farms are only part of their farm activities. </li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> complain about the prices. Yes, you probably can get it from Walmart cheaper. However, you are paying for quality. You are also supporting local business and having a great experience too.&nbsp;You may not realize that most of these operations donate trees and garlands. They give to local charities and families in need. It may seem like “they&#8217;re making a lot of money.” However, consider that their season is only 6 weeks long. The rest of the year there they are not making income from their Christmas trees. This experience isn&#8217;t expensive when you consider the cost of a movie or concert ticket. It&#8217;s a great deal. Plus, you get to come home with a Christmas tree. Its a pretty good deal in my opinion. Enjoy the farm and what they offer. </li>



<li><strong>DO</strong> make it a joyful time. Have fun.  Going to the Christmas tree is a fun tradition for many families.  Be kind and courteous to the other guests too. </li>



<li><strong>DO</strong> support a local farmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The money stays in your local community and another small farm stays in business.  Local money stays local.   This is good for local economies. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Real Christmas Tree Care</strong></p>

<p>Real trees need water, a lot of water. When you bring a tree home, cut one-quarter inch or more off the base of the trunk.&nbsp; Keep the tree outdoors if you are not ready to bring it in. Protect it from the sun and wind. The sun and wind can damage the needles leaving turning brown and making your tree look old and dry. &nbsp; &nbsp; Again, before bringing the tree inside, cut off a minimum of a one-quarter inch from the base of the trunk. This opens the tree stem so it can take up water.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Right away place your tree in a stand and fill it with fresh water.&nbsp; If the water level drops below the cut, the tree will make a new seal over the stem. You will need to make a new cut for the tree to soak up water again.&nbsp; Your tree is like a cut flower. It needs fresh water throughout the holiday season to look its best.&nbsp; Trees are very thirsty.&nbsp; They can drink from 2 pints to a gallon of water each day.&nbsp; It is helpful to use a tree stand that holds a gallon of water or more.&nbsp; Your tree will need to be checked often to ensure there is enough water in the stand.&nbsp; A tree can be kept for 4-6 weeks if watering regularly. &nbsp; This should keep your tree looking its best though out the season.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Living Christmas Trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Getting a living Christmas tree is really becoming a popular option for many property owners. I see the attraction, planting a tree after it is done being a decoration is an awesome idea.&nbsp; Its a great way to plant a tree to help the environment. Once you get a potted tree, you must take care of it throughout the holiday season. Ensure it has water. Make sure the tree isn&#8217;t near heat ducts.&nbsp; The hot ,dry air, dry&#8217;s out the needles and hurt the plant. &nbsp; It is essentially a big house plant.   If you plan on bringing a living Christmas tree home, dig a hole early. Do this when the ground is not hard frozen. This way, you can plant the tree after the holidays. &nbsp; Add mulch into the hole to prevent it from freezing.&nbsp; When it&#8217;s time to plant the tree outside, store the hole&#8217;s dirt in a place that doesn&#8217;t freeze. Then, refill the hole. Place the dirt in a basement or garage to prevent freezing. &nbsp;By spring, the tree should be rooted well and continue to grow. You can continue to enjoy your Christmas tree all year long.</p>



<p><strong>Holiday Safety</strong></p>



<p>It is easy to get caught up in the holiday spirit.  We don&#8217;t want to do anything that ruin this time of year.  We need to talk about safety around real trees.  </p>



<p><strong>Electric Lights and Candles </strong></p>

<p>Before decorating your tree, check all of the electric lights and connections. Make sure there are no frayed wiring or cords.&nbsp; Do not use lights or electric cords that are showing signs of wear.&nbsp;With any electric decoration, do not overload the electrical circuits. Even though the lights are only used once a year they can have significant damage from year to year. It is not worth using old lights that could be a fire hazard. Never use lighted candles on your tree.&nbsp; There are so many great candle alternatives with LEDs that look and feel real it&#8217;s not worth the risk. I thought putting candles on your tree was a thing of the past. However, every year, homes get burned down because someone lit a candle on or close to their tree. &nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>Heater and Fireplaces</strong></p>



<p>Don&#8217;t place trees near heat sources like heaters or fireplaces. &nbsp; Heat sources will dry your tree prematurely making it brittle and the needles fall off. If the tree is placed too near heat sources, it can be a fire hazard.&nbsp;  If you are planning to burn you tree after the holidays wait few months before burning. Ensure it is fully dry to enjoy a nice bonfire. Burning a Christmas tree right after the holidays can cause creosote buildup in your chimney. A fresh tree can also result in a very smoky fire. </p>

<p>Pets can pose a threat to your Christmas tree. Cats are notorious for tipping over trees. Dogs have been known to use trees as an indoor outhouse. It is necessary to protect your tree from your animals.</p>



<p> Pets love Christmas decorations.  Cats are commonly found chewing on cords and playing with ornaments.  Protect any cords your pet could come in contact with.  Look for and avoid any glass or breakable ornaments that could hurt your pet.  We make sure we put unbreakable ornaments near the bottom of the tree. </p>

<p>Be aware of anything on your tree that could even smell tasty to your pet. They sniff out anything edible, like candy canes or salt dough ornaments or ornaments made of chocolate. I have experience with the dogs and candy canes the mess was unbelievable. My poor Labrador was sick from all of the sugar  from the candy canes and candy wrappers. It cost us an emergency vet visit.  To avoid extra Christmas bills, make sure food ornament&#8217;s are out of reach of your pet. </p>

<p>Dogs are known to chew on real trees. You need to protect your tree in some way.  Some people put a protective fence like a baby gate around the tree.  People have gotten creative and even put Christmas trees on the ceiling!</p>



<p><strong>Stabilize Your Tree</strong>. </p>



<p>Look at the stability of the tree. You want to secure the tree toward the top to limit tipping hazards. Consider getting a Christmas tree stand that is wider and stronger to withstand your animals or children. If you have an adventurous animal or child, making sure your tree is secured to the wall. This extra step could save a lot of time and cleanup. It could also prevent injuries if your pet or child decides to tip it over. </p>



<p>Real Christmas trees are a great way to celebrate the holidays. I hope you consider a natural tree as part of your holiday traditions. Go and enjoy your holidays and consider a Real Christmas tree. Let me know your favorite holiday TREEdition. Comment and share. </p>
