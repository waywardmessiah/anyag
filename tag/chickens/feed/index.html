<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you may have already experienced the heartbreak of an attack on your flock. Discovering that your birds have been harmed is a devastating moment for any caretaker. While you might have an idea of what predator is responsible, identifying the exact culprit is crucial. Many people struggle to pinpoint the predator(s) attacking their flock. To help you in this battle, here is a primer on the most common animals that prey on chicken flocks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Minks</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1121" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/02/07/protect-your-chickens-top-predator-threats-you-need-to-know/mink-7614407_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mink-7614407_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1440" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mink-7614407_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mink-7614407_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mink-7614407_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="768" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mink-7614407_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1121" style="width:377px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Minks are often the most misidentified predators of chicken flocks. These elusive creatures are widespread and typically go unnoticed. They usually attack at night, moving silently and swiftly. Often, they kill their prey before the birds can make any noise. Minks tend to live nearby, often under sheds or other structures, and can decimate an entire flock in a single night, sometimes even stacking the bodies. Their stealth and efficiency make them particularly dangerous to poultry.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Mink-proofing your coop is challenging but essential. Using hardware cloth with openings smaller than Â½ inch can help keep minks out. Additionally, having a good dog, especially one with some terrier in it, can be effective in rooting out minks from your property. It&#8217;s crucial to regularly inspect your coop and surrounding areas for signs of mink activity and take preventive measures to protect your flock.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foxes</h2>

<p>Foxes like snatch and grab birds from roost. They usually are active during the dawn and dusk.&nbsp; Protecting chickens from foxes requires a combination of physical barriers and vigilant practices. One of the most effective methods is to build a secure coop with sturdy materials, such as hardware cloth, which is more resistant to foxes than chicken wire. The coop should have a solid floor to prevent foxes from digging underneath, and the door should be securely latched. Additionally, installing an electric fence around the perimeter of the chicken run can deter foxes from approaching. It&#8217;s also important to ensure that the coop is elevated off the ground, as this makes it more difficult for foxes to access.  Putting bird in a protected coop at night is the best way to protect against foxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to physical barriers, maintaining a clean and secure environment is crucial. Regularly check for any gaps or weaknesses in the coop and repair them promptly. Keep the area around the coop free of food scraps and other attractants that might lure foxes. Using motion-activated lights or alarms can also help scare away potential predators. Finally, consider getting a guard animal, such as a dog or a rooster, which can alert you to the presence of foxes and help protect the flock. By combining these strategies, you can create a safer environment for your chickens and reduce the risk of fox attacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Snakes</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1127" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/02/07/protect-your-chickens-top-predator-threats-you-need-to-know/1280_blackratsnakereptile_harfmann246/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1280_blackratsnakereptile_harfmann246.jpg" data-orig-size="1280,853" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;9&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1357309400&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="1280_black+rat+snake,+reptile_harfmann246" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1280_blackratsnakereptile_harfmann246.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1280_blackratsnakereptile_harfmann246.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1280_blackratsnakereptile_harfmann246.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1127" style="width:358px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Protecting chickens and their eggs from snakes involves creating a secure environment and implementing preventive measures. Start by ensuring that the chicken coop is well-built with no gaps or holes that snakes can slither through. Use hardware cloth with small mesh sizes for the coop and run, as this material is more effective at keeping snakes out compared to standard chicken wire. Elevate the coop off the ground to make it harder for snakes to access. Additionally, keep the area around the coop clean and free of debris, tall grass, and woodpiles, as these can provide hiding spots for snakes.</p>



<p>Another effective strategy is to use natural deterrents and barriers. Planting snake-repellent plants, such as marigolds and lemongrass, around the coop can help keep snakes at bay. You can also use snake-proof fencing, which is typically made of fine mesh and buried several inches into the ground to prevent snakes from burrowing underneath. Regularly inspect and maintain the fencing to ensure there are no gaps or weaknesses. Finally, consider using motion-activated lights or alarms to scare away snakes and other predators. By combining these methods, you can create a safer environment for your chickens and protect their eggs from snake predation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Raccoons</h2>



<p>Protecting chickens from raccoons involves creating a secure environment and being vigilant. Start by ensuring that the chicken coop is well-built with no gaps or weak points that raccoons can exploit. Use sturdy materials like hardware cloth for the coop and run, and make sure the doors and windows are securely latched. Elevate the coop off the ground to make it harder for raccoons to access. Additionally, install motion-activated lights or alarms around the coop to deter raccoons from approaching. Keep the area around the coop clean and free of food scraps or other attractants that might lure raccoons.</p>

<p>If a raccoon does attack, it&#8217;s important to act quickly and calmly. First, try to scare the raccoon away by making loud noises or using a hose to spray water at it. If the raccoon is inside the coop, carefully open the door to allow it to escape. After the attack, check your chickens for injuries and provide any necessary medical care. Clean up any mess and reinforce the coop to prevent future attacks. A raccoon attack typically involves signs of struggle, such as feathers scattered around, broken eggs, and injured or missing chickens. By taking these precautions and being prepared, you can help protect your chickens from raccoon attacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coyotes</h2>



<p>Coyotes are cunning predators that can pose a significant threat to chicken flocks. They are known for their ability to dig under fences and squeeze through small gaps, making it essential to have a secure coop and run. Using hardware cloth with small mesh sizes and burying it several inches into the ground can help prevent coyotes from digging underneath. Additionally, installing an electric fence around the perimeter of the chicken run can act as a strong deterrent. Keeping the area around the coop clean and free of food scraps or other attractants is also crucial in reducing the likelihood of coyote visits.</p>

By taking these precautions and being prepared, you can help protect your chickens from coyote attacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Opossums</h2>



<p>Possums can pose a significant threat to chicken flocks, primarily due to their opportunistic feeding habits. They are known to raid chicken coops at night, searching for eggs and sometimes even attacking young or weak chickens. Possums are excellent climbers and can easily access coops that are not securely closed or have gaps in the structure. They can also dig under fences to gain entry. Once inside, they can cause considerable damage, not only by eating eggs and attacking chickens but also by spreading diseases through their droppings and saliva.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1133" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/02/07/protect-your-chickens-top-predator-threats-you-need-to-know/opossum/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opossum-.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="opossum-" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opossum-.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opossum-.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="680" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opossum-.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1133" style="width:361px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>To protect your chickens from possums, it&#8217;s essential to reinforce the coop and run with sturdy materials like hardware cloth, which is more resistant to possums than standard chicken wire. Ensure that all doors and windows are securely latched and that there are no gaps or holes in the structure. Elevating the coop off the ground can also make it more difficult for possums to access. Additionally, keeping the area around the coop clean and free of food scraps or other attractants can help reduce the likelihood of possum visits. Regularly inspecting and maintaining the coop and run will help ensure that your chickens remain safe from possum attacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skunks</h2>



<p>Skunks can be a significant problem for chicken flocks due to their opportunistic feeding habits. They are known to raid chicken coops at night, searching for eggs and even attacking vulnerable chickens. Skunks are excellent diggers and can easily burrow under fences to gain access to the coop. Once inside, they can cause considerable damage, not only by eating eggs and attacking chickens but also by spreading diseases through their droppings and saliva. The presence of skunks can also attract other predators, further increasing the risk to your flock.</p>

<p>To protect your chickens from skunks, it&#8217;s essential to reinforce the coop and run with sturdy materials like hardware cloth, which is more resistant to skunks than standard chicken wire. Ensure that all doors and windows are securely latched and that there are no gaps or holes in the structure. Elevating the coop off the ground can also make it more difficult for skunks to access. Additionally, keeping the area around the coop clean and free of food scraps or other attractants can help reduce the likelihood of skunk visits. Regularly inspecting and maintaining the coop and run will help ensure that your chickens remain safe from skunk attacks. Using motion-activated lights or alarms can also deter skunks and other nocturnal predators from approaching the coop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Owls</h2>



<p>Owls can be a significant threat to chicken flocks, especially during the night when they are most active. To protect your chickens from owl attacks, it&#8217;s essential to secure the coop and run with sturdy materials. Use hardware cloth with small mesh sizes to cover any openings, including windows and ventilation holes, to prevent owls from reaching inside. Ensure that the coop is securely closed at night and that there are no gaps or weak points that owls can exploit. Additionally, consider installing a roof or netting over the chicken run to prevent owls from swooping down and attacking your chickens.</p>

<p>Another effective strategy is to use deterrents to keep owls away from the coop. Motion-activated lights or alarms can startle owls and discourage them from approaching. You can also use visual deterrents, such as reflective tape, owl decoys, or scarecrows, to create an environment that is less attractive to owls. Regularly inspect and maintain the coop and run to ensure that they remain secure and free of any potential entry points. By combining these methods, you can create a safer environment for your chickens and reduce the risk of owl attacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hawks</h2>



<p>Hawks are formidable predators that can pose a significant threat to chicken flocks, especially during the day when they are most active. These birds of prey have keen eyesight and powerful talons, making them capable of swooping down and capturing chickens with ease. Hawks typically target smaller or younger chickens, but they can also attack adult birds if given the opportunity. The presence of hawks can cause stress and panic among the flock, leading to decreased egg production and overall health. To protect your chickens from hawk attacks, it&#8217;s essential to implement a combination of physical barriers and deterrents.</p>

<p>One of the most effective measures is to cover the chicken run with netting or wire mesh to prevent hawks from swooping down. Ensure that the netting is securely fastened and has no gaps that hawks can exploit. Additionally, providing plenty of hiding spots, such as bushes, trees, or shelters, can give chickens a place to take cover if a hawk is spotted. Using visual deterrents, such as reflective tape, owl decoys, or scarecrows, can also help keep hawks away. Motion-activated lights or alarms can startle hawks and discourage them from approaching the coop. Regularly inspecting and maintaining the coop and run will help ensure that your chickens remain safe from hawk attacks. By combining these strategies, you can create a safer environment for your flock and reduce the risk of hawk predation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mice</h2>



<p>Mice can pose a significant threat to chicken flocks, primarily due to their ability to spread diseases and contaminate food and water sources. They are notorious for chewing through feed bags, nesting in bedding, and leaving droppings that can harbor harmful bacteria and parasites. Additionally, mice can attract larger predators, such as snakes and raccoons, which pose an even greater risk to the flock. To protect your chickens, it&#8217;s essential to maintain a clean and secure coop, store feed in rodent-proof containers, and regularly inspect for signs of mice. Using traps and natural deterrents, such as peppermint oil, can also help keep mice at bay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;To keep mice at bay, consider using mouse baiting stations or rodent-proof feeders. You can create a baiting station using PVC pipes and poison blocks placed in the center, ensuring only rodents can access them. Additionally, having a good barn cat that isn&#8217;t interested in your birds can help keep rodents in check. Mice can also chew on tail feathers, so it&#8217;s essential to take preventive measures.</p>



<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, protecting your chicken flock from a variety of predators requires a combination of vigilance, secure housing, and preventive measures. Each predator, from minks and foxes to raccoons, coyotes, possums, skunks, owls, hawks, and even mice, presents unique challenges. By understanding their behaviors and implementing appropriate strategies, such as using hardware cloth, securing coops, installing motion-activated lights, and maintaining a clean environment, you can significantly reduce the risk of attacks and ensure the safety and well-being of your chickens. Regular inspections and timely repairs are also crucial in maintaining a secure and predator-free coop.  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Starting or renovating a pasture requires careful consideration of forage species suited to your animals and goals. Key factors include soil testing, choosing between mixed or pure stands, and managing weeds. Selecting appropriate forages based on conditions and livestock needs enhances productivity and ensures successful pasture management.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Forage Species for Your Pasture</strong></h3>



<p>Starting a pasture from scratch or renovating an existing one requires knowing what forages are present and which will work best for your operation. Consider what will work for your animals and your goals for the pasture. Are you providing entertainment, extra nutrition, or all of your animal&#8217;s nutrition? Identifying the current forages and any weeds is crucial, especially if you&#8217;re renovating. Weed maintenance might be necessary to prevent them from robbing your pasture.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a pasture to &#8220;do it all,&#8221; you might be disappointed. Decide if the forage is for hay or grazing and plant accordingly. Trying to make a pasture do everything often leads to frustration. Adjust your expectations and plan based on your goals. Successful pastures rely on good soil conditions, forage species selection, and favorable weather. With hard work, research, and a bit of luck, you can achieve great forages.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Soil Testing</strong></h3>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so, conduct soil tests in your intended pastures, preferably in the fall. This will help determine which forages will thrive and if any soil amendments are needed to maximize productivity. For more information, refer to the soil testing article on enhancing garden soils here.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mixed Stand vs. Pure Stand</strong></h3>



<p>Choosing between mixed and pure stands is important. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Forage Groups</strong></h3>



<p>Understanding forage terminology is essential. Here are some common groups:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cool Season Grasses</strong></h4>



<p>These grasses thrive in cooler temperatures, like in spring and fall.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Warm Season Grasses</strong></h4>



<p>These grasses grow during the summer months when temperatures are warmer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Legumes</strong></h4>

<p>Legumes are protein-rich forages that can fix nitrogen from the air, making it usable for the plant. They grow in all seasons and supplement animal protein.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Perennial and Annual Forages</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Perennial Forages:</strong> These are the mainstay of your pastures, lasting year after year. Some may only last a few years.</p>



<p><strong>Annual Forage Crops:</strong> These can supplement during pasture slumps and help finish off livestock. Double cropping, where you sew other crops into your perennial forages, can extend grazing later into the season and break disease and pest cycles. Examples include small grains like wheat, barley, or oats, followed by summer annual grasses or forage turnips.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avoid Prepackaged Mixes</strong></h3>



<p>Prepackaged mixes from feed stores can be misleading and wasteful. They often contain older seeds with lower germination rates and may not provide the right mix for your pasture. It&#8217;s better to select and mix your seeds based on your specific needs.</p>

<p>Consider your animals&#8217; needs, grazing system, weather, and soil conditions. Look at common forages and determine which are right for your animals. Soil tests will help you decide if those forages will thrive in your environment. Selecting forages can be daunting and may take several grazing seasons to get the right mix.</p>

<p>Frozen water Buckets!</p>



<p>&nbsp;Frozen Buckets!!&nbsp; You probably had to deal with frozen water for your livestock.&nbsp; Frozen livestock water is the bane of almost all animal farmers. It doesn&#8217;t matter if its chickens or cattle, everyone deals with frozen water sometimes. There are hundreds of &#8220;tried and true &#8221; ways to keep your animal water open. There are a lot of homemade DIYs, and some may work. Each farm is unique.  This discussion of how to keep livestock waters open encompass the most successful ideas. &nbsp; Let me know what works for you. I would love to see your ideas.</p>



<p>There are many types of electric heaters out on the market for every type of animal. These can range from being pretty inexpensive to very expensive. Some have many bells and whistles to ensure your water is open and animals are safe. The biggest drawback to electric waters is the need to have electricity run to where your water is needed. This can get complicated when you have multiple waters to keep open. </p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Electric Heaters</h2>



<p>Most electric heaters will not melt ice but rather keep existing liquid water open. It is important to start using electric heaters when the water is still open and liquid. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Electric Cords</h5>



<p>Running extension cords can be dangerous. Many cords  are not rated for outdoors and wet areas. Animals can chew on the cords becoming a shock risk. Running multiple extension cords can put extra load on circuits. Always have an electrician look at your electricity to make sure your circuits can handle the extra load. This is also a wise idea to make sure there hasn&#8217;t been damage over the summer to the wires. Barn fires happen all the time, most are caused by electrical issues. If in doubt, consult an electrician. This extra step can save you thousands of dollars and a world of heartache.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bucket Heaters</h3>



<p>Bucket heaters and trough heaters are popular, pretty inexpensive and effective as long as the animals will leave them alone. &nbsp; I had a horse that liked to play with the floating trough heater.&nbsp; He would rip the heater out of the wall and play with it in the pasture. After breaking the heater a couple of times, we got a submersible trough heater. We also got a deeper trough and kept the water filled so he wouldn&#8217;t pull it out. What about the pipes?&nbsp; Again, there are numerous ways to heat up pipes to keep them frost free. Wrap exposed pipes with insulation, rubber, or foam pipe covers. You can also use blankets, towels, or layers of newspaper.&nbsp; Beware, if you are also using some electrical means of frost prevention make sure the cord is protected from animals and in good working order.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enclosed Pump and/or Tank</h3>



<p>Enclose the pump and tank: Contact a licensed well contractor to help enclose your pump and tank. It&#8217;s really hard to pump water if you pump is frozen.&nbsp; Winterizing the pump can prevent damage from the elements and ensure it is working all winter long.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Insulate</h2>



<p>Insulate: Put a water bucket inside a larger bucket and fill the space with straw, hay, or shavings.&nbsp; This is a good solution if you don&#8217;t have weeks and weeks of freezing temperatures. Insulated buckets are also a good choice but can be more expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Solar Power</h3>



<p>Use solar power: Black buckets absorb the sun&#8217;s heat. You can cover part of a water trough with a solar cover. Snow cover can be an issue with using solar heat. This works best with a large trough of water that has access to the sun to warm it.&nbsp; On the market now there are some solar powered trough heaters.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compost</h2>



<p>Use compost: Pile compost around the buckets or troughs to use the heat from composting.&nbsp; The main issue with this is keeping the compost out of the buckets so it doesn&#8217;t contaminate the water.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Freeze Miser</h3>



<p>Use a Freeze Miser: This device helps keep water dripping as temperatures reach freezing levels.&nbsp; Freeze Miser automatically adjusts the waterâs flow rate to the water temperature. As a result, you donât waste more water than necessary to prevent it from freezing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Propane Heater</h3>



<p>Use a propane heater: Propane heaters can keep water warm even if the electricity goes out. However, propane can be expensive and dangerous, so make sure to buy a heater with a good safety rating.&nbsp; Propane heaters can be an issue when there is a lot of flammable debris around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Constant Flow Water</h3>



<p>Use a constant flow waterer: These can work well in temperatures well below zero Fahrenheit. If temperature remains low this watering system can have a heated component to make sure the water doesn&#8217;t freeze.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manure</h3>



<p>Use manure: Fill a tank with fresh manure and bank around the sides, leaving an area for drinking. This can work as the manure breaks down it will warm up the tank. This system has issues with animals being exposed to parasites. Manure can also be introduced to the water which leads to contamination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pop Bottles</h3>



<p>Use pop bottles: Put pop bottles containing salt water into small tanks. The tanks can still freeze if the freezing temperatures remain low for an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nesting Tanks</h3>



<p>Nest a smaller tank inside a larger one: Use bottom shims to bring the smaller rim above the larger. The air around the smaller tank acts as insulation to help keep the water open. This is effective with freezing temperatures that don&#8217;t last a long time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heated Hoses</h3>



<p>Heated hoses. These can be very expensive. A heated hose is more than wrapping heat tape around a hose. They are specially designed to handle heat and water. Avoid using heat tape alone. You might find out that the hose has melted. This could short out your electricity.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What About Small Animals?</h2>



<p>Chickens, other poultry and rabbits are a special consideration when the weather turns cold.&nbsp; Chickens and Poultry need open water to be accessible but usually they are in small amounts that freeze quickly.&nbsp; There are many commercial products such as electric heated waters and heated bases to keep water open.&nbsp; Heated nipples work great for poultry.  Putting a bucket heater in the water works too as long as the water container wonât melt.&nbsp; Heated water bowls work great too. Be aware of DIY what were not intended to be waters such as crock pots or other household appliances. They were not meant to be used in barns or coops and are not meant to be run constantly.&nbsp; They are a fire hazard. Please be careful.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rabbits can be a challenge in winter. Rabbits do great in cold temperatures but watering them is pain.&nbsp; Using water bottles for small animals, will require you to change and unthaw the bottles a couple times a day. If you are using crocks for water, then the crocks will need to be emptied and refilled. I recommend going with plastic crocks for the winter as ceramic crock may break. &nbsp; Rabbit watering systems it can be pretty easy to add a heated component to keep water flowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Water</h3>



<p>How much water you need?&nbsp; Every animal needs fresh, clean water every day. The amount of water any animal needs is dependent on the animal species and use.&nbsp; For example, beef cow will use less water than a dairy cow in milk production. Animals can change their water consumption based on other factors like, if they are lactating or breeding.&nbsp; Your water needs to accommodate your animals water needs. &nbsp; When the temperature gets colder animals tend to drink less.&nbsp; Animals under stress and poor water quality can lead to animals getting dehydrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><strong>Animal</strong></td><td colspan="2"><strong>Water Consumption, Typical</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>(Gallons per Day)</strong></td><td><strong>(liter per day)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chickens/100</td><td>6</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cow, Dry</td><td>15</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Milking Cows</td><td>35</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy Calves (1-4 months)</td><td>2.4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy Heifers (5 &#8211; 24 months)</td><td>6.6</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Dry Cows</td><td>9.3</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Hog</td><td>4</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Horse, Steer</td><td>12</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Pig, feeder</td><td>1.1 &#8211; 2</td><td>5 &#8211; 9</td></tr><tr><td>Sheep</td><td>2</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Rabbits</td><td>1-2 oz per pound</td><td>50-150 ml per kilo</td></tr><tr><td>Goats</td><td>1-3&nbsp;</td><td>4-5&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Llama/ Alpaca</td><td>2-5 gallons</td><td>7.5 &#8211; 19&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Turkeys/100</td><td>20</td><td>75</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Water tends to hold on to heat. It releases the heat when the air temperature is colder than the water.&nbsp; Large amounts of water hold more heat and in turn release more heat. Large bodies of water freeze over last because of the heat that is in the water. &nbsp; Mist rising from the surface of a pond is an indication that the pond is warmer than the current air temperature.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easier to keep a large trough open rather than several small buckets.&nbsp; If all you have are buckets. You will need to knock out ice to refill them frequently throughout the day when it is freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ice that forms on top of a bucket or trough can insulate the rest of the water, slowing the water from freezing. &nbsp; With a large trough, sometimes, it&#8217;s better not to break all the ice off the top to help insulate the rest of the trough.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There&#8217;s Plenty of Snow?!</h2>



<p>While sometimes there is more snow then we know what to do with it. Snow is not a reliable option for watering your animals.&nbsp; Some animals will eat snow, but they are likely not getting enough moisture through snow alone.&nbsp; Snow also can be contaminated and can be dirty. &nbsp; Some animals simply cannot eat enough snow to get enough liquid.&nbsp; Snow is cold and can lead to some animal getting frostbite.&nbsp; Remember it takes 10-13 inches of snow to equal 1 inch of rain.&nbsp;  For example, it will take 10 gallons of snow to make up 1 gallon of water.&nbsp; &nbsp;Animal especially large animals will find it is impossible for them to âeatâ enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor or Outdoor</h2>



<p>Where your water is placed will affect how well your water solutions work. Is the water indoors or outdoors?</p>



<p>Indoor water will be protected from weather and wind. It is more likely to stay open when the temperatures are near 32 degrees F. Water being indoors has the benefit of not being in the weather so routine care can be easier. Indoor water can be messy and when the water thaws, can be a big mess inside your shelters.&nbsp; Making sure you have good drainage.  When the water does decide to melt, will save a lot of mud and muck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Outdoor watering is what most people with grazing animals have to deal with.&nbsp; Outdoor water situations can be great or can be hazardous.&nbsp; When using stock tanks, or an automatic waterer, animals tend to hang around the water if there isn&#8217;t enough grazing or forage.   Animals hanging round the can pit up the ground making is muddy ground around the tanks. If the ground is frozen it can be slippery and/or uneven ground causing hoof injury.  Adding Geo fabric or gravel around trough and water sources can reduce mud and hoof injury.  </p>



<p>I wanted to mention a quick mention about farm emergencies.  Most commonly when the power goes. This can affect you water pumps or water heaters.  Need to make a plan to deal with water emergencies.   How can you make sure you animals will get what they need?  Have a plan.  Are you ready?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quick Note: About Generators</h3>



<p>If you can afford a generator that is wonderful.  Make sure it is in good working order and winterized every year.  What is your generator able to handle as far as output.  Can it run you well pump? Is it powerful enough to run electricity to your house?   Know what the capacity is before bad weather. Make a plan on what you would the generator for.  </p>



<p>Dealing with frozen water is not a lot of fun. Farmers have been dealing with this for a very long time. Technology has some great way to deal with frozen water for livestock. It is worth the time and money to put in a system that will work for your farm.   Have a plan, execute plan. make adjustments as necessary.   </p>
