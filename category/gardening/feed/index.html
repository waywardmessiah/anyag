<p>Moles can be the bane of lawn owners, especially this time of year when questions about mole control peak. Indiana is home to two mole species: the widespread <strong>Eastern Mole</strong> and the <strong>Star-nosed Mole</strong>, primarily seen in the northern part of Indiana. It&#8217;s important to distinguish moles from rodents—they’re not the same. Moles are <strong>insectivores</strong>, feeding on insects rather than grains.</p>



<p></p>



<p>While moles can frustrate homeowners due to lawn and garden damage, they offer benefits. Their tunnels aerate soil, improving air and water penetration, and support healthier plant growth. Moles also control soil insect populations, eating pests that can damage landscaping. Furthermore, moles play an essential role in the food chain, serving as prey for hawks, owls, and snakes. If garden plants are damaged, <strong>mice</strong> sharing mole runways are often the culprits—not the moles themselves.</p>

<p>Moles are fascinating creatures with unique adaptations for their subterranean lifestyle. Here&#8217;s a deeper look into their biology, behavior, and ecological role:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biology and Physical Features</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Family</strong>: Moles belong to the Talpidae family, which includes various species adapted to life underground.</li>



<li><strong>Body Structure</strong>: Their elongated, cylindrical bodies and short, powerful legs with strong claws make them expert diggers. Some species even have an extra thumb on each fore paw, aiding their burrowing abilities.</li>



<li><strong>Sensory Adaptations</strong>: Moles have small, underdeveloped eyes and no external ears, as vision and hearing are less critical underground. Instead, they rely on a keen sense of smell and touch, enhanced by specialized organs called Eimer&#8217;s organs.</li>



<li><strong>Fur</strong>: Their dense, water-repellent fur allows them to move easily through soil and stay warm in cool environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Behavior and Habitat</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Diet</strong>: Moles are insectivores, consuming insects and earthworms. They can eat up to 60-100% of their body weight daily.</li>



<li><strong>Tunneling</strong>: Moles create extensive tunnel systems, which can reach up to 150 feet of new tunnels daily. These tunnels serve as hunting grounds and living spaces.</li>



<li><strong>Activity</strong>: They are most active in moist, loamy soil and prefer early mornings or evenings, especially after rain.</li>



<li><strong>Reproduction</strong>: Moles are solitary animals, interacting only during mating season. They have a high reproductive rate, with short gestation periods.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ecological Role</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Soil Aeration</strong>: By digging tunnels, moles aerate the soil, improving air and water penetration. This benefits plant growth and promotes nutrient circulation.</li>



<li><strong>Pest Control</strong>: Moles help control soil insect populations, reducing pests that can damage crops and landscaping.</li>



<li><strong>Food Chain</strong>: Moles are prey for predators like hawks, owls, and snakes, playing a vital role in the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fun Facts</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Some mole species, like the star-nosed mole, have unique adaptations, such as a star-shaped nose with sensory receptors for detecting prey.</li>



<li>Moles can dig at a rate of 18 feet per hour, showcasing their incredible strength and efficiency.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why Moles Are More Active in Spring</strong></p>



<p>Spring marks the breeding season for moles. During this time, they create more visible tunnels in search of mates, increasing the likelihood of lawn damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Works  </strong> Mole control is not easy but it can be done.  The most reliable method for mole control is trapping.  The key to this method is patience practice and persistence.  You need to be careful when setting traps.  Improperly set traps will not trap moles.  For successful trapping it is essential to locate the main runways.  The runways are more or less straight for some distance; they appear to connect mounds.   They follow man made borders or the perimeters of fields or yards.   There are several types of traps, but a harpoon trap is probably the easiest trap to use.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mole Control Methods That Don’t Work</strong></h3>



<p><strong>What Doesn’t Work&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;There are other interesting, but largely ineffective approaches to mole control.&nbsp; Grub control is often suggested to get rid of moles.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that the grubs only make up a small portion of a mole’s diet.&nbsp; Also the loss of beneficial earthworms and insects due to repeated pesticide application to control grubs can generate more problems than just trapping the moles.&nbsp; This is a very expensive way to control moles with little likelihood of success.&nbsp; Poison gasses and baits are also often tried without much success.&nbsp; These poison gasses are called fumigants and need an airtight system to be effective.&nbsp; Mole tunnels are not airtight and usually the fumigant can’t penetrate the extensive tunnel network. Poison baits don’t work because they re usually in grain or pellet form.&nbsp; Remember, moles are insectivores and would not try a bait that wasn’t six legged.&nbsp; There are several repellents on the market all of which are NOT proven to work.&nbsp; There are many “home remedies” to try to combat the moles.&nbsp; These are usually desperate homeowners trying to place things in tunnels to irritate the moles into going away.&nbsp; These don’t work either.&nbsp; Broken glass and razor blades can potentially be harmful to children or pets that play in the yard, or can be harmful later when you decide to plant something in the same place you placed the dangerous objects. Gum, rose branches, and human hair are not effective.&nbsp; Pouring bleach, using mothballs, or dumping petroleum products in the tunnels will seriously harm the environment, kill beneficial insects, make domestic pets and/or children sick, and could contamination of the ground water. Further, mothballs are carcinogenetic. It is illegal to use mothballs, bleach and oil in a manner not dictated on the package.&nbsp; If that wasn’t bad enough bleach, mothballs, and petroleum products don’t work to eliminate or deter moles.. Caster oil has been touted to work on mole control, but the results are questionable at best.&nbsp; Pumping water into the tunnels will only served to waste water and devices to frighten the moles don’t appear to have any value in mole control.&nbsp; Ultrasonic transmitters are a nice idea, but they don’t work either.&nbsp; So please “Buyer Beware!” when purchasing products for mole control. &nbsp; You can spend a lot of money and still have moles in your lawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, while moles can be a nuisance for lawn and garden owners, they also bring significant ecological benefits. Their tunneling improves soil health and supports nutrient circulation, while their insectivorous diet helps control pest populations. For effective mole management, trapping remains the most reliable method, provided it is done with patience and proper technique. Avoid gimmicks, harmful substances, and methods that compromise the environment or waste resources. By understanding the behavior and ecological importance of moles, we can strike a balance between managing their presence and appreciating the role they play in maintaining a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Home Greenhouses: A Guide to Extending Your Growing Season</strong></p>



<p>Greenhouses and cold frames are fantastic tools for any gardening enthusiast, offering opportunities to extend your growing season, start crops early, protect sensitive plants, and even grow year-round. These structures are perfect for getting your hands in the soil during colder months. For many, nurturing green, growing plants during the gray days of winter can bring a sense of hope and joy.</p>



<p>However, before you jump into owning a greenhouse, there are several important factors to consider. Thinking through these questions will help you choose the right greenhouse for your needs and ensure you’re prepared for this rewarding endeavor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Determining Your Purpose</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenline1/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg" data-orig-size="603,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GreenLine1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" loading="lazy" width="603" height="477" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-1522" /></figure>



<p>Start by asking yourself: <strong>What’s the purpose of my greenhouse?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you want to grow year-round?</li>



<li>Are you cultivating orchids or other plants that require a temperature-controlled environment?</li>



<li>Do you need a head start on the growing season?</li>



<li>Is it part of a plan to expand your gardening operation for profit?</li>



<li>Are you look to grow fresh, off-season vegetables for your family?</li>



<li>Do you want a multi-functional structure that can serve different purposes?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re clear about how you’ll use the greenhouse, it’s time to dive deeper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Considerations</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do you have a suitable location?</strong> This is one of the most critical questions to address.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pay attention to how the sun’s position changes throughout the year, as this can affect light quality and intensity. Ensure your greenhouse gets adequate sunlight.</li>



<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> If possible, opt for an <strong>east-west orientation</strong> to distribute light evenly and maximize the winter sun. This setup is also better suited to handle prevailing winds, especially in windy regions.</li>



<li><img width="478" height="322" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3e5XMiFpB-oGcAKZcPKRvUQldjuI3IGZDDSX8IPZC5Lc1WtMK5hv5BrKxF1WvHKC321CekqeyRSjm31v5p-dpaumtuda22XUizK1bmz5c81Rk-IhP2E0CsCDXZgRDR-vFW8Pe?key=1k9zzEbJMXdDmcC7_JVjJhKn" alt="Sun Orentation1.gif"></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Before taking the plunge, take into account the following practical details:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Space:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient space and check for potential obstructions like trees and fences.</li>



<li><strong>Heating:</strong> Determine if you want a heat source you’ll use and budget for associated heating expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Consider local climate conditions, such as gray winter days, strong winds, snow fall and seasonal challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Slope and Drainage:</strong> Avoid placing your greenhouse at the bottom of a slope and ensure proper drainage to prevent water logging.  Also A greenhouse in a valley area will be colder then one that is on top of a hill. Cold air slides downhill. </li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Decide between automatic or manual ventilation to regulate temperature and humidity effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Electricity and Water:</strong> Ensure that your greenhouse has reliable access to electricity and water.</li>



<li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Plan for cooling solutions such as shade cloth, during summer months to prevent overheating.</li>



<li><strong>Zoning and Property Values:</strong> Check local ordinances for zoning regulations and consider how the greenhouse may impact neighborhood relations.</li>



<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Think about future needs—plan ahead for potential expansion as your gardening experience grows.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budget Planning</strong></h3>

<p>When planning your project, the first question to ask yourself is, “How much am I willing to spend?” Setting a clear and realistic budget is crucial, as expenses can accumulate faster than anticipated. Beyond the initial costs, don’t overlook ongoing expenses such as electricity, water, and maintenance.  Recurring costs can significantly impact your long-term financial commitment.</p>



<p>While the allure of adding convenient features and premium upgrades may be tempting, staying within your budget ensures financial stability and prevents overspending. One smart strategy is to prioritize essential components first. Begin with a more basic setup that meets your immediate needs, and then enhance it gradually as resources allow. By pacing yourself, you’ll achieve a balance between functionality and affordability without compromising your financial goals.</p>



<p>Remember, a well-planned budget isn’t just about limiting spending—it’s about making the most of the resources you have while staying adaptable to future improvements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pests and Disease Management</strong></h3>

<p><strong>What’s your plan for managing pests and diseases?</strong> All greenhouses face these challenges eventually. Consider whether you’ll pursue organic methods and prepare a strategy to address these issues effectively. Learn to implement IPM.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong></h4>



<p>Integrated Pest Management combines multiple methods to create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to pest and disease control. IPM focuses on prevention, monitoring, and targeted interventions to minimize chemical use and maintain a healthy greenhouse ecosystem.</p>



<p>By implementing these strategies, you can maintain a thriving greenhouse environment and keep your plants healthy year-round. Let me know if you&#8217;d like me to expand further or focus on any specific pest or disease issue!</p>



<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in greenhouses is a strategic and environmentally conscious approach to pest control. It involves a combination of practices to manage pests effectively while minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Key components of IPM include regular monitoring of pest populations, accurate identification of pests, and the use of biological control agents such as beneficial insects or microorganisms. Cultural practices like maintaining optimal environmental conditions and sanitizing greenhouse spaces also play a vital role in preventing pest outbreaks. By integrating these methods, greenhouse growers can ensure sustainable pest management that protects crops, reduces chemical residues, and supports a healthier ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants to thrive, but they can also create a favorable setting for pests and diseases to multiply. The warm, humid conditions that benefit your plants may also attract unwanted visitors like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, or fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew and botrytis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Is Key</strong></h4>



<p>Taking proactive measures can help reduce the likelihood of outbreaks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep your greenhouse clean by removing plant debris and regularly disinfecting tools, pots, and surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Quarantine New Plants:</strong> Inspect and isolate new plants before introducing them to the greenhouse.</li>



<li><strong>Healthy Plants:</strong> Maintain proper care for plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure adequate airflow to prevent humidity from reaching levels that encourage fungal growth.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection</strong></h4>



<p>Constant vigilance is crucial for catching problems before they escalate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check plants frequently for signs of pests like holes, discoloration, sticky residue, or webbing.</li>



<li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Use yellow or blue sticky traps to monitor flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.</li>



<li><strong>Soil Checks:</strong> Periodically inspect soil for pests like fungus gnats or root-knot nematodes.</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Control Methods</strong></h4>



<p>If issues arise, there are several ways to address them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewings, or predatory mites, to combat pests naturally.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Sprays:</strong> Use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or horticultural oils, to manage pests without harmful chemicals.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Rotate crops, avoid overcrowding, and remove infected plants promptly to limit the spread of diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> As a last resort, apply pesticides or fungicides, ensuring they are appropriate for the problem and safe for use in greenhouses. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disease-Specific Tips</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Prevent fungal issues by controlling humidity levels and avoiding overhead watering.</li>



<li><strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Avoid working with plants when they’re wet, as this can spread bacterial pathogens.</li>



<li><strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Viruses are often spread by pests like aphids. Manage pest populations to reduce the risk of viral transmission.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing Setup</strong></h3>

<p>Think about the logistics of your greenhouse:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planting Methods:</strong> Will you grow directly in the ground, in raised beds, or on tables?</li>



<li><strong>Nutrient Delivery:</strong> How will you provide nutrients to your plants? Have a clear plan for their care and growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>For beginners, starting small and expanding over time as you gain experience is a wise approach. There are many affordable, ready-to-assemble kits that are perfect for backyard gardeners and can help you hone your skills before committing to a larger setup.</p>

It’s the perfect solution for anyone curious about greenhouse gardening without making a big commitment. A great way to experiment with greenhouse growing while keeping it cost-effective and hassle-free!&#8221; <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/01/10/diy-greenhouse-easy-steps-for-beginners/">Quick and Dirty Cattle Panel Greenhouse Article</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LYnZ8jvhUA">Quick and Dirty Cattle panel Greenhouse YouTube Video </a></p>

<p>&nbsp;Even though it is November there is still plenty to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Soil sampling&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get soils sampling done before the ground freezes.&nbsp; Later fall is an ideal time.&nbsp; I explain solid sampling in my blog post about Soils.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t already brought your houseplants, now is the time. House plants that have been on the porch should have been protected enough from light frost. They should have been in a protected location. Houseplants that have been outside and just brought indoors will benefit from a trim. This trimming lessens the amount of foliage that will inevitably wilt and die.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal for houseplants to feel a little shocked when they return indoors after being outside all summer. &nbsp;Your houseplants will slow growing and will need less water and fertilizer.&nbsp; With leaf drop happening it is very easy to over water your indoor plants.&nbsp; You may need to move your houseplant to the sunniest areas. Add supplemental lighting if the leaf drop is becoming a mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Potting up Spring Flower Bulbs to Force Indoors in Mid Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Pot up spring flower bulbs such as daffodils and paper whites pot them up so just the tips are exposed.&nbsp; Then refrigerate for 10-13 weeks.&nbsp; After the cold period, put in a sunny location and allow it to grow. Blooms should happen in 3-4 weeks after putting them in sunny location. &nbsp; You will thank me later in the winter if you do this now.&nbsp; Also, you can just put the bulbs in the refrigerator and pot up in 10-13 weeks. It may take a little longer for the bulbs to bloom since they need to grow root system.</p>



<p><strong>Bring Poinsettias Back</strong></p>

<p>Put poinsettias in complete darkness from 5 pm to 8 am daily until early December. This routine will force the red (or other color) bracts to show. Once the leaves start to show color, you may bring them out of their dark routine.  A bract is the color that is shown on the leaves giving the poinsettia is colors. </p>



<p><strong>Outdoors, Things to Get Done.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of any really nice November days. Use this time to work on some outdoor tasks before you put up your Christmas lights. It will save yourself a ton of time, energy and work if you do some simple thing to get ready for winter</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Rodent Damage to Trees</strong></p>



<p>Prevent rabbit and rodent damage on trees by putting up physical barriers around trunks by using hardware cloth.&nbsp; The hardware cloth must be ¼ inch or less to be effective. Chicken wire is not going to help you out and it can be frustrating to work with.&nbsp; Chemical repellents are going to be less effective, are always temporary, expensive and not always foolproof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Young Trees Need Care Before Winter</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week many will see our first frost of the Autumn. &nbsp; The first frost marks the end of the growing season. It signals it is time to put our outdoor endeavors to sleep for the winter. Some are still actively harvesting and caring for the last fruits or vegetables out of the garden.&nbsp; This late in the season there should only be a few crops left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frosts are inevitable in the Midwest. &nbsp; Locally, we have experienced a long period of warm weather. It is dry and giving us an extended summer this year. &nbsp; We are well within the normal period for the first frost. The first frost can happen anywhere from Oct 1 &#8211; Nov 1 and be well within average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a difference between a frost and a freeze.&nbsp; Some people will use the two words interchangeably but there is a difference.&nbsp; A frost occurs when a thin layer of ice forms on a surface. This happens when the surface temperature is on or near 32 degrees F. &nbsp; A freeze occurs when the air temperature is 32 degrees or below for a significant period of time. A hard freeze happens when the air temperature is 28 degrees or lower for an extended period.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>What will happen to the&nbsp; apples, pumpkins, and other late-season vegetable crops?</strong></p>



<p>But what about the apples? Can we go to the apple orchard and still pick apples? I haven&#8217;t gotten my Apple Cider donuts yet this year. The answer is yes. Apples are pretty resilient to colder temperatures. Commercially, apples are stored 30-32 degrees F, so a little frost should not be of concern. Apples will freeze at a temperature between 27.8 and 29.4 *F, depending on the cultivar, and frozen fruit will deteriorate rapidly. By the time these temperatures happen we have already had some minor frosts and hopefully your apples have been harvested. If a freeze is predicted, there is not much one can do. It is impractical to try and protect large trees or if you have many trees. If frost is a huge concern, you should apply blankets or tarps over one or two dwarf trees. However, this would only give a couple of degrees of protection. This could be done to protect fruit if they are unripe and there are only one or two frosts predicted. This would be impractical for a longer amount of time. If the fruits are ripe, they should be picked and either used or stored. If fruit are not ripe, they will not mature substantially once they are removed from the tree. So it is important to keep the fruit on the tree to ripen. </p>

<p><strong>What about the Pumpkin Spice?</strong></p>

<p>Pumpkins should be protected from frost.&nbsp; Pumpkins can tolerate a light frost. However, a hard frost or freeze will decrease their storage life. You will be left with mushy pumpkins.&nbsp; Most of the pumpkin vine has shriveled up by now&nbsp; so you should harvest your pumpkins. &nbsp; If you still have vines that are growing, you can offer a few degrees of protection. Cover the plants with blankets and such. However, it may not be worth the time and trouble.&nbsp; Pumpkins are best stored at 50-55º F if they want to keep them at their best until Halloween. &nbsp; And wait to carve pumpkins until closer to Halloween, once the outer skin has been opened up pumpkins deteriorate quickly and even quicker if it is freezing</p>



<p><strong>What About My Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Other vegetable plants vary in their sensitivity to cold temperatures.&nbsp; Tender crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, and okra, might withstand light frost if protected.&nbsp; Blankets and tarps are only protective for a few degrees. &nbsp; If temperatures dip into the 20’s, covering the plants won’t likely provide enough protection and the plants will freeze.&nbsp; Harvest all the remaining fruit and vegetables of these plants. The frost will damage the fruit, making them mushy and unappetizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some cool season crops such as beets, carrots, lettuce, and potatoes will stand a light frost even without covering. They can be harvested after frost. Some root crops can stay in the ground and be harvested throughout the winter.&nbsp; This only works in areas that are consistently cold. Otherwise, the root crops will rot in the ground with repeated freeze thaw cycles.&nbsp; &nbsp; Other cool season crops, like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi, will tolerate even a light freeze. These crops can actively grow in cooler temperatures and handle several frosts before the plant starts to have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> In my opinion mulching is the best way to protect your garden.  Mulching is a good way to protect very small gardens.  Use several layers of newspaper, straw or chopped corn stalks.  For those with large gardens, it may be more practical to protect only a few plants of each crop.  Blankets, tarps, floating row covers, or other large materials can be placed over rows of vegetables for protection.  There are a lot of products on the market that can help you extend your gardening season. Most are very effective. Cloches, paper tents, hot caps, and plastic walls of water are the more effective but expensive ways for frost protection.  All frost protection takes more time and effort on your part.  You can cause more damage if these are left on when the days are warm, but the nights are cold.  In cases of light frost, sometimes only the upper and outer foliage are damaged. The plants can still continue production.  </p>



<p>If plant covering is not feasible, pick as much produce as possible if frost is predicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What About My Tomatoes?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Most crops will not ripen any further once picked, but tomatoes are an exception. Mature green tomatoes can be ripened to full color indoors.&nbsp; Light is not necessary to ripen tomatoes.&nbsp; In fact, ripening of tomatoes is mostly affected by temperature.&nbsp; The warmer the temperature, the faster the ripening. Extensive warmth will over ripen your tomatoes before you get a chance to eat them. &nbsp; To store tomatoes for later use, wrap the fruit individually in newspaper and store at 55 degrees F. &nbsp; Make sure the tomatoes have no blemishes or soft spots.&nbsp; The fruits will gradually ripen in several weeks. This can give you garden fresh tomatoes well into the late fall, early winter.&nbsp; Some varieties of tomatoes store better then others varieties such as Roma or San Marzano. I once had a client that was so good at storing tomatoes that they would store them into January. &nbsp; They had a root cellar that had perfect temperatures. They were meticulous about getting rid of tomatoes with blemishes.&nbsp; They would take a few tomatoes out, warm them up and they would ripen. My client loved having fresh tomatoes in January. Many gardeners would envy them for having a fresh tomato during this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use this information to help plan next year&#8217;s garden. Plant fruit and vegetables that can extend your gardening season.&nbsp; Knowing which plants tolerate frost is important. It is also crucial to know which ones aren&#8217;t frost tolerant. This knowledge is key to being able to harvest your garden well into the Autumn.&nbsp; Your tender plants would need the most protection.&nbsp; Planting them so you can install hoops or some other way to easily put frost protection over the plants in the spring will make it much easier in the fall when you are extending your season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Vegetable Tolerance Chart</strong></p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown vegetables and indicates their tolerance to frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)</td><td>Semi-Hardy<br>(Tolerant light frost)<br></td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Beans</td><td>Beets</td><td>Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td>Cucumber</td><td>Carrot</td><td>Brussels sprouts</td></tr><tr><td>Eggplants</td><td>Cauliflower</td><td>Cabbage</td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand Spinach</td><td>Celery</td><td>Collards</td></tr><tr><td>Okra</td><td>Chard</td><td>Kale</td></tr><tr><td>Pepper</td><td>Chinese Cabbage</td><td>Kohlrabi</td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>Endive</td><td>Mustard Greens</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td><td>Lettuce</td><td>Onion</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Corn</td><td>Parsnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet potato</td><td>Potato</td><td>Peas</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato</td><td>Salsify</td><td>Radish</td></tr><tr><td>Watermelon</td><td></td><td>Spinach</td></tr><tr><td>Melons</td><td></td><td>Turnip</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Herb Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Herbs can be more difficult to figure out which ones are frost tolerant and which ones are not. Several herbs are perennial, meaning they die back every year and come back in the spring. &nbsp; Herbs are a little different because they have some different modes of survival.&nbsp; Some Herbs are annuals but will sow their seeds and then come back each year from the seed from the previous year. These are not technically cold hardy plants but their seed survives. Some self sewing in cold temp&nbsp;are cilantro/coriander, dill, borage, calendula,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another type of herb life cycle that can also come back are Biennials. Biennial plants are plants that come back and complete their life cycle in two seasons.&nbsp; Biennials&nbsp;herbs include angelica, caraway, clary, parsley, watercress. These will die back then come back in the spring to complete there life cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown herbs and indicates their tolerance to frost.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)<br></td><td>Semi Hardy<br>(Tolerate light frost)</td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Basil</td><td>Lavender</td><td>Chives</td></tr><tr><td>Rosemary</td><td>Catnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Rue</td><td>Hyssop</td><td>Mint</td></tr><tr><td>St. Johns wort</td><td>Comfrey</td><td>Sorrel</td></tr><tr><td>Valerian</td><td>Feverfew</td><td>Tarragon</td></tr><tr><td>Chamomile</td><td>Lemon Balm</td><td>Thyme</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Lovage</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Fruits Trees?</strong></p>



<p>Fruit&nbsp; and cold tolerance has many different factors. There are three stages of cold hardiness. One stage,&nbsp; is the plant. Can the plant survive the cold temperature?&nbsp; The second, is  the fruit, can the fruit deal with frost or cold temperature.&nbsp; Third, and perhaps most importantly, what stage is the plant in when the cold temperatures occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the fruit plants, most fruit trees commonly found in the Midwest can handle pretty cold temperatures and survive.&nbsp; In the fall most of the fruit on plants have already been harvested except for apples and some pears.&nbsp; Apples are a special fruit as their fruit can withstand some frosts. &nbsp; Some people may have raspberry plants that has put on a second crop in the fall. These berries are very susceptible to a frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The plant stage has more to do with surviving frost than anything else.&nbsp; The flowering stage is the most sensitive for all fruiting plants. &nbsp; This is why we hear a lot about spring frosts hurting the fruit crops.&nbsp; Spring frost will kill flower tissue and hurt the plant&#8217;s pollination. So, for most fruit plant spring frost are the most dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Strawberries have other concerns about overwintering. They do best when mulched overwinter to help the crowns survive.&nbsp; Summer producing fruit only has to worry about frosts in the spring.&nbsp; Apricots, most berries, peaches, plums, and nectarines are very susceptible to frost injury in the spring, by the time autumn frost happens these plants have already been harvested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you harvest your vegetables have you noticed any UGV or unidentified growing Vegetables?</p>



<p><br>Does it look like aliens planted something to hatch in your garden? Maybe you&#8217;re wondering if your plants cross pollinated and you happen to get a Cucamelon or some sort of bizarre alien squash that was supposed to be a pumpkin but looks more like a Squashkin?  Are you wondering if you planted your zucchini too close to your melons or your pumpkin too close to your cucumbers? Did you end up with squashkins? Will planting cucumbers next to watermelons yield cucamelons?</p>



<p><br>No, it&#8217;s not likely that aliens have invaded and are planting our gardens with their grotesque spawn. In reality cucumbers and melons are not likely to cross-pollinate one another, so the answer is probably no. Plants of different species usually do not cross-pollinate in nature. Cross-pollination does frequently take place among some of the winter squash, pumpkins and gourds that are closely related. You would not see it this year with your current crop. It may happen with the seed collected from this year&#8217;s crop planted and grown next year.</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>Let&#8217;s discuss a little botany to explain. The fruit of any plant is actually a mature ovary, botanically speaking. The seed inside is similar to a child while the fruit is comparable to the mother. The seed, or child, has characteristics of both mother and father. The fruit on the other hand will look like the mother plant. In other words, if cross-pollination did take place, the seed, not the fruit, would be the result of that cross. The seed is a hybrid of the mother and father plants.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="255" height="223" data-attachment-id="191" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/09/27/unidentified-growing-vegetables-are-aliens-invading-your-garden/073rby37/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png" data-orig-size="255,223" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="073rby37" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=255" alt="" class="wp-image-191" style="width:406px;height:auto" srcset="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png 255w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/073rby37.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></figure></div>


<p><br>The seed would have to be harvested, stored and planted the following year to determine if cross-pollination had an effect. Then, the resulting fruit on those plants might look like a combination of both parents. There are open pollinated varieties of vegetables that will always look like the parent plant. In my article Heirlooms vs Hybrid I go into more detail about the differences of open pollinated plants and hybrids.</p>



<p><br>If you do turn up some unexpectedly odd-looking fruits in your squash patch, it is possible that the seed packet contained a few seeds that were of questionable cross-bred parentage.  It happens sometimes, but most likely it is more likely that a &#8220;volunteer&#8221; squash from last year&#8217;s garden is the culprit. Sometimes these can be from the neighbor&#8217;s garden that a bird or another animal has brought into your garden. They&#8217;re not aliens but just a natural crossbred vegetable. The real question is can you eat it? The short answer is yes most of the time there are edible, that is not the same as if it tastes good. Many times, the taste you want is not the taste you get. Other times hybrid has superior taste. It&#8217;s all a matter of how the genetics of the parent plants worked out. Sometimes these Squashkins make some of the best Jack-o-lanterns so there is some use for those. As far as the cucamelons go, most likely they are an interesting oddity in your garden, and you can enjoy showing them off to friends and family. If you do see little green men in your garden, make sure they aren’t local children playing tricks on you otherwise you may want to call the government as those might just be aliens</p>

<p>Jack-O-Lantern</p>



<p>The tradition of carving pumpkin dates back for many centuries. The people of Ireland and Scotland used to carve scary faces in to turnips and Potatoes. They did this to deter evil spirits from entering their homes. In England they sometime used large beets to Jack-o-Lanterns. When immigrating came to America, they brought this tradition with them but found a more suitable native fruit, the pumpkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be surprised to learn that they are over 50 verities of pumpkins.&nbsp; There is a lot of research done by university to attempt to improve the quality of the pumpkin for production. Some improvement to pumpkins are rot resistance. Another way breeding programs improved pumpkin quality was to strengthen the Handle or connection point of the vine to the pumpkin so they stay connected.  </p>



<p>Selecting a pumpkin can be a challenge.&nbsp; You always want to select a ripe pumpkin. Select a pumpkin&nbsp;that has no bruises or soft spots. These bruises or soft spots may be signs of the pumpkin starting to spoil. It may not last until you use the pumpkin.&nbsp;Store the pumpkins in a cool dry place where there is enough space between pumpkins to allow air to circulate.&nbsp; This will help prevent bruising of the flesh.&nbsp; On bad spot on a pumpkin can affect the others. &nbsp; You never want to carry a pumpkin by the stem.&nbsp; The stem can easily brake and you may wind up with a squash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When picking pumpkins to eat, you may be better off with smaller pie pumpkins. These pumpkins  have better flavor and less water than really big pumpkins. Also, if you intend to eat you pumpkin it is best not to carve it.&nbsp;Decorating it with paint or stickers  is a creative way to make you smaller pie pumpkins even more festive. </p>



<p>Carving jack o lanterns is a tradition for this time of the year.&nbsp; When you are planning to carve with children please make&nbsp; sure there is adult supervision.&nbsp; For small children it may be better to allows them to decorate their pumpkins with stickers, paints or markers.&nbsp; There are many creative ideas that can be done to decorate a pumpkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When carving it is best to carve it the same day you intend to use it.&nbsp; However you can carve a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Make sure to cover it in cling wrap .&nbsp; Cover the lid and place it back in the pumpkin, makes sure there is a layer of plastic between the lid and the ledge.&nbsp; Cover the whole pumpkin in plastic covering the carvings and place in the refrigerator.&nbsp; Be sure not to freeze the pumpkin it will turn in to a mushy mess.&nbsp; If you need to restore a shriveling pumpkin soak it for 2-6 hours .Be careful not to over soak it because the pumpkin can crack.&nbsp; Vaseline or vegetable oil spread on the cult edges can help make you carving last longer be sealing in the moisture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many tools out there to help carve pumpkins. Many of them have safely feature to help prevent injuries. If you use a kitchen knife make sure it is very sharp. The pumpkin skins are very hard to get thought and adult help is needed. When cutting into the pumpkin to gut it try cutting it out on the bottom. A cut on the bottom can help the pumpkin sit securely on a surface. It is easier to take the insides out. You can make a tasty snack by roasting the seeds of the pumpkin. Scrap the edges so they are about 1 inch thick. Any thicker and it may be difficult to carve into, any thinner and the carving may loose its shape. Pumpkin carving is a lot of fun and can bring the whole family together. If you take safety precautions everyone can have a safe and fun holiday. </p>



<p>After you have finished make sure to save the seed and make a delicious snack. On my recipes page you can get a quick tried and true recipe for <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/favorite-recipes/">roasting pumpkin seeds</a>.</p>

<p>Should one grow Heirloom or Hybrid plants? This is a discussion that keeps coming up between local gardeners and horticulture professionals. There is a lot of confusion about both types of plants. Heirloom plants can be defined in many ways, but there are some characteristics that many of the definitions share.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are always open pollinated.&nbsp; This means that the seeds from this year’s plants will grow to be just like that of the parent plant.&nbsp; That true-to-seed characteristic makes Heirloom seeds able to be harvested and saved year after year.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are usually varieties that have been around for a long period of time. Some believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been around for longer than 50 years.&nbsp; This period of time can vary depending on who you talk to.&nbsp; Some people believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been handed down over generations of seed savers; they feel that Heirloom plants are a part of their cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hybrid Advantages</strong></p>



<p>Hybrid plants&nbsp; are developed by taking two different plants and cross pollinating them to try to create a better plant. For example, scientists may take two different tomato plants, one that has big fruit and one that is disease resistant. These two plants are cross- pollinated in hopes that the resulting offspring may be a plant that has big fruit and is also disease resistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Heirloom Advantages</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Heirloom plants is that they are known for excellent flavor, color, or fragrances.&nbsp; Heirloom plants come in a large variety of shapes and sizes which are fun to have in the garden.&nbsp; They have a strong cultural connection for many gardeners.&nbsp; However, Heirloom plants also have some disadvantages. They can be less hardy or disease resistant.&nbsp; Some seeds may take a longer time to germinate. The germination rates for Heirloom seeds may be low or erratic. &nbsp; The growth habit of Heirloom seeds can seem wild or unruly. &nbsp; Heirloom plants may not produce as many fruits or flowers as hybridized plants. They can also have traits that are undesirable such as thorns or ugly fruit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Hybrid plants is that they are very dependable for producing flowers or fruits. &nbsp; They tend to produce more fruits or flowers.&nbsp; They generally have better and faster germination rates than Heirloom plants. Some Hybrid vegetables will produce all at once so it is easier to predict when the crop is ready to be harvested. Hybrid plants also have a more predictable growth habit.&nbsp; One of the big disadvantages of Hybrid plants is that sometimes one trait is sacrificed for another, for example, flavor is sacrificed for disease resistance.&nbsp; Also, if you find a plant that you really like you will have to buy new seeds year after year.&nbsp; Hybrid plants may also cost more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most gardeners raise a combination of Heirloom and Hybrid plants, desiring traits from both types. Because there are so many exceptional varieties of both Heirloom and Hybrid plants it is worth experimenting with growing both types to decide what works best for you.&nbsp; Part of the fun is looking around at all the beautiful tomatoes that are in the garden right now and determining which one you would like to grow next year.&nbsp; Make sure you take notes in your garden journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been growing for Tomatoes for year and I like to plant a variety of tomatoes. I love to grow Heirlooms for eating fresh and love to grow hybrids for cooking and canning. Let me know what your preference. </p>
