<p><strong>Home Greenhouses: A Guide to Extending Your Growing Season</strong></p>



<p>Greenhouses and cold frames are fantastic tools for any gardening enthusiast, offering opportunities to extend your growing season, start crops early, protect sensitive plants, and even grow year-round. These structures are perfect for getting your hands in the soil during colder months. For many, nurturing green, growing plants during the gray days of winter can bring a sense of hope and joy.</p>



<p>However, before you jump into owning a greenhouse, there are several important factors to consider. Thinking through these questions will help you choose the right greenhouse for your needs and ensure you’re prepared for this rewarding endeavor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Determining Your Purpose</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenline1/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg" data-orig-size="603,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GreenLine1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" width="603" height="477" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenline1.jpg?w=603" alt="" class="wp-image-1522" /></figure>



<p>Start by asking yourself: <strong>What’s the purpose of my greenhouse?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you want to grow year-round?</li>



<li>Are you cultivating orchids or other plants that require a temperature-controlled environment?</li>



<li>Do you need a head start on the growing season?</li>



<li>Is it part of a plan to expand your gardening operation for profit?</li>



<li>Are you look to grow fresh, off-season vegetables for your family?</li>



<li>Do you want a multi-functional structure that can serve different purposes?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re clear about how you’ll use the greenhouse, it’s time to dive deeper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Considerations</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do you have a suitable location?</strong> This is one of the most critical questions to address.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pay attention to how the sun’s position changes throughout the year, as this can affect light quality and intensity. Ensure your greenhouse gets adequate sunlight.</li>



<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> If possible, opt for an <strong>east-west orientation</strong> to distribute light evenly and maximize the winter sun. This setup is also better suited to handle prevailing winds, especially in windy regions.</li>



<li><img width="478" height="322" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3e5XMiFpB-oGcAKZcPKRvUQldjuI3IGZDDSX8IPZC5Lc1WtMK5hv5BrKxF1WvHKC321CekqeyRSjm31v5p-dpaumtuda22XUizK1bmz5c81Rk-IhP2E0CsCDXZgRDR-vFW8Pe?key=1k9zzEbJMXdDmcC7_JVjJhKn" alt="Sun Orentation1.gif"></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Before taking the plunge, take into account the following practical details:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Space:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient space and check for potential obstructions like trees and fences.</li>



<li><strong>Heating:</strong> Determine if you want a heat source you’ll use and budget for associated heating expenses.</li>



<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Consider local climate conditions, such as gray winter days, strong winds, snow fall and seasonal challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Slope and Drainage:</strong> Avoid placing your greenhouse at the bottom of a slope and ensure proper drainage to prevent water logging.  Also A greenhouse in a valley area will be colder then one that is on top of a hill. Cold air slides downhill. </li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Decide between automatic or manual ventilation to regulate temperature and humidity effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Electricity and Water:</strong> Ensure that your greenhouse has reliable access to electricity and water.</li>



<li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Plan for cooling solutions such as shade cloth, during summer months to prevent overheating.</li>



<li><strong>Zoning and Property Values:</strong> Check local ordinances for zoning regulations and consider how the greenhouse may impact neighborhood relations.</li>



<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Think about future needs—plan ahead for potential expansion as your gardening experience grows.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budget Planning</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1524" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/savings-2789137_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="savings-2789137_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=750" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/savings-2789137_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1524" style="width:555px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p>When planning your project, the first question to ask yourself is, “How much am I willing to spend?” Setting a clear and realistic budget is crucial, as expenses can accumulate faster than anticipated. Beyond the initial costs, don’t overlook ongoing expenses such as electricity, water, and maintenance.  Recurring costs can significantly impact your long-term financial commitment.</p>



<p>While the allure of adding convenient features and premium upgrades may be tempting, staying within your budget ensures financial stability and prevents overspending. One smart strategy is to prioritize essential components first. Begin with a more basic setup that meets your immediate needs, and then enhance it gradually as resources allow. By pacing yourself, you’ll achieve a balance between functionality and affordability without compromising your financial goals.</p>



<p>Remember, a well-planned budget isn’t just about limiting spending—it’s about making the most of the resources you have while staying adaptable to future improvements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pests and Disease Management</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="1526" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/aphid-5154237_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aphid-5154237_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aphid-5154237_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1526" style="width:611px;height:auto" /></figure>



<p><strong>What’s your plan for managing pests and diseases?</strong> All greenhouses face these challenges eventually. Consider whether you’ll pursue organic methods and prepare a strategy to address these issues effectively. Learn to implement IPM.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong></h4>



<p>Integrated Pest Management combines multiple methods to create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to pest and disease control. IPM focuses on prevention, monitoring, and targeted interventions to minimize chemical use and maintain a healthy greenhouse ecosystem.</p>



<p>By implementing these strategies, you can maintain a thriving greenhouse environment and keep your plants healthy year-round. Let me know if you&#8217;d like me to expand further or focus on any specific pest or disease issue!</p>



<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in greenhouses is a strategic and environmentally conscious approach to pest control. It involves a combination of practices to manage pests effectively while minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Key components of IPM include regular monitoring of pest populations, accurate identification of pests, and the use of biological control agents such as beneficial insects or microorganisms. Cultural practices like maintaining optimal environmental conditions and sanitizing greenhouse spaces also play a vital role in preventing pest outbreaks. By integrating these methods, greenhouse growers can ensure sustainable pest management that protects crops, reduces chemical residues, and supports a healthier ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Greenhouses provide an ideal environment for plants to thrive, but they can also create a favorable setting for pests and diseases to multiply. The warm, humid conditions that benefit your plants may also attract unwanted visitors like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, or fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew and botrytis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Is Key</strong></h4>



<p>Taking proactive measures can help reduce the likelihood of outbreaks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep your greenhouse clean by removing plant debris and regularly disinfecting tools, pots, and surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Quarantine New Plants:</strong> Inspect and isolate new plants before introducing them to the greenhouse.</li>



<li><strong>Healthy Plants:</strong> Maintain proper care for plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure adequate airflow to prevent humidity from reaching levels that encourage fungal growth.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring and Early Detection</strong></h4>



<p>Constant vigilance is crucial for catching problems before they escalate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check plants frequently for signs of pests like holes, discoloration, sticky residue, or webbing.</li>



<li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Use yellow or blue sticky traps to monitor flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.</li>



<li><strong>Soil Checks:</strong> Periodically inspect soil for pests like fungus gnats or root-knot nematodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Control Methods</strong></h4>



<p>If issues arise, there are several ways to address them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Biological Controls:</strong> Introduce beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewings, or predatory mites, to combat pests naturally.</li>



<li><strong>Natural Sprays:</strong> Use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or horticultural oils, to manage pests without harmful chemicals.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Rotate crops, avoid overcrowding, and remove infected plants promptly to limit the spread of diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> As a last resort, apply pesticides or fungicides, ensuring they are appropriate for the problem and safe for use in greenhouses. Always follow the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disease-Specific Tips</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Prevent fungal issues by controlling humidity levels and avoiding overhead watering.</li>



<li><strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Avoid working with plants when they’re wet, as this can spread bacterial pathogens.</li>



<li><strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Viruses are often spread by pests like aphids. Manage pest populations to reduce the risk of viral transmission.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing Setup</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1528" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2025/03/20/essential-greenhouse-tips-for-successful-gardening/greenhouse-827464_1920/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="greenhouse-827464_1920" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greenhouse-827464_1920.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" /></figure>



<p>Think about the logistics of your greenhouse:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planting Methods:</strong> Will you grow directly in the ground, in raised beds, or on tables?</li>



<li><strong>Nutrient Delivery:</strong> How will you provide nutrients to your plants? Have a clear plan for their care and growth.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting Small</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Note on Materials:</strong> Use treated or plastic wood for the base to ensure longevity and structural integrity. The plastic covering can be purchased inexpensively, and you might find role ends at a cheaper price. Wiggle wire, used in the greenhouse industry, makes adjusting the plastic easy. Greenhouse repair tape is UV-protected and more durable than clear plastic or duct tape. Pipe insulation is cheap and easy to find, and construction screws help ensure the structure stays together longer.</p>

<p><strong>Shape the Panels:</strong></p>



<p>For a more Gothic shape, bend the panels to create a point. This is an aesthetic choice leaving the round shape also helps reduce snow and wind load.</p>

<p>Cut angles in the 2x4s so the top point holds up the end of the panel. Measure to ensure the correct angle based on your base size.</p>

<p>This structure can be modified from here to be use for livestock or storage. Instead of adding clear plastic, add a tarp to offer shade and protection. On the ends of the structure, wire can be added to protect livestock. The possibilities are endless.</p>



<p>You should have a structure that looks like this:</p>

<p>Cover the main structure with plastic. Secure the plastic using furring strips and screws, or use wiggle wire for easier adjustments. If you are using furring strips and screws, Line up the one furring strip on either side of the cattle panels. Screw the furring strips together make sure you avoid the cattle panel wire. Screw to secure the plastic about 2 ½ feet from the bottom to allow for ventilation. You need to allow some overhanging plastic on the ground so you can role up the sides to allow venation. you will want to secure the plastic with cinder blocks, gravel or even dirt.</p>



<p><strong>Cover the Ends:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Even though it is November there is still plenty to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Soil sampling&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get soils sampling done before the ground freezes.&nbsp; Later fall is an ideal time.&nbsp; I explain solid sampling in my blog post about Soils.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you haven’t already brought your houseplants, now is the time. House plants that have been on the porch should have been protected enough from light frost. They should have been in a protected location. Houseplants that have been outside and just brought indoors will benefit from a trim. This trimming lessens the amount of foliage that will inevitably wilt and die.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal for houseplants to feel a little shocked when they return indoors after being outside all summer. &nbsp;Your houseplants will slow growing and will need less water and fertilizer.&nbsp; With leaf drop happening it is very easy to over water your indoor plants.&nbsp; You may need to move your houseplant to the sunniest areas. Add supplemental lighting if the leaf drop is becoming a mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Potting up Spring Flower Bulbs to Force Indoors in Mid Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Pot up spring flower bulbs such as daffodils and paper whites pot them up so just the tips are exposed.&nbsp; Then refrigerate for 10-13 weeks.&nbsp; After the cold period, put in a sunny location and allow it to grow. Blooms should happen in 3-4 weeks after putting them in sunny location. &nbsp; You will thank me later in the winter if you do this now.&nbsp; Also, you can just put the bulbs in the refrigerator and pot up in 10-13 weeks. It may take a little longer for the bulbs to bloom since they need to grow root system.</p>



<p><strong>Bring Poinsettias Back</strong></p>

<p>Put poinsettias in complete darkness from 5 pm to 8 am daily until early December. This routine will force the red (or other color) bracts to show. Once the leaves start to show color, you may bring them out of their dark routine.  A bract is the color that is shown on the leaves giving the poinsettia is colors. </p>



<p><strong>Outdoors, Things to Get Done.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of any really nice November days. Use this time to work on some outdoor tasks before you put up your Christmas lights. It will save yourself a ton of time, energy and work if you do some simple thing to get ready for winter</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Rodent Damage to Trees</strong></p>



<p>Prevent rabbit and rodent damage on trees by putting up physical barriers around trunks by using hardware cloth.&nbsp; The hardware cloth must be ¼ inch or less to be effective. Chicken wire is not going to help you out and it can be frustrating to work with.&nbsp; Chemical repellents are going to be less effective, are always temporary, expensive and not always foolproof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Young Trees Need Care Before Winter</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week many will see our first frost of the Autumn. &nbsp; The first frost marks the end of the growing season. It signals it is time to put our outdoor endeavors to sleep for the winter. Some are still actively harvesting and caring for the last fruits or vegetables out of the garden.&nbsp; This late in the season there should only be a few crops left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frosts are inevitable in the Midwest. &nbsp; Locally, we have experienced a long period of warm weather. It is dry and giving us an extended summer this year. &nbsp; We are well within the normal period for the first frost. The first frost can happen anywhere from Oct 1 &#8211; Nov 1 and be well within average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a difference between a frost and a freeze.&nbsp; Some people will use the two words interchangeably but there is a difference.&nbsp; A frost occurs when a thin layer of ice forms on a surface. This happens when the surface temperature is on or near 32 degrees F. &nbsp; A freeze occurs when the air temperature is 32 degrees or below for a significant period of time. A hard freeze happens when the air temperature is 28 degrees or lower for an extended period.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>What will happen to the&nbsp; apples, pumpkins, and other late-season vegetable crops?</strong></p>



<p>But what about the apples? Can we go to the apple orchard and still pick apples? I haven&#8217;t gotten my Apple Cider donuts yet this year. The answer is yes. Apples are pretty resilient to colder temperatures. Commercially, apples are stored 30-32 degrees F, so a little frost should not be of concern. Apples will freeze at a temperature between 27.8 and 29.4 *F, depending on the cultivar, and frozen fruit will deteriorate rapidly. By the time these temperatures happen we have already had some minor frosts and hopefully your apples have been harvested. If a freeze is predicted, there is not much one can do. It is impractical to try and protect large trees or if you have many trees. If frost is a huge concern, you should apply blankets or tarps over one or two dwarf trees. However, this would only give a couple of degrees of protection. This could be done to protect fruit if they are unripe and there are only one or two frosts predicted. This would be impractical for a longer amount of time. If the fruits are ripe, they should be picked and either used or stored. If fruit are not ripe, they will not mature substantially once they are removed from the tree. So it is important to keep the fruit on the tree to ripen. </p>

<p><strong>What about the Pumpkin Spice?</strong></p>

<p>Pumpkins should be protected from frost.&nbsp; Pumpkins can tolerate a light frost. However, a hard frost or freeze will decrease their storage life. You will be left with mushy pumpkins.&nbsp; Most of the pumpkin vine has shriveled up by now&nbsp; so you should harvest your pumpkins. &nbsp; If you still have vines that are growing, you can offer a few degrees of protection. Cover the plants with blankets and such. However, it may not be worth the time and trouble.&nbsp; Pumpkins are best stored at 50-55º F if they want to keep them at their best until Halloween. &nbsp; And wait to carve pumpkins until closer to Halloween, once the outer skin has been opened up pumpkins deteriorate quickly and even quicker if it is freezing</p>



<p><strong>What About My Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Other vegetable plants vary in their sensitivity to cold temperatures.&nbsp; Tender crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, and okra, might withstand light frost if protected.&nbsp; Blankets and tarps are only protective for a few degrees. &nbsp; If temperatures dip into the 20’s, covering the plants won’t likely provide enough protection and the plants will freeze.&nbsp; Harvest all the remaining fruit and vegetables of these plants. The frost will damage the fruit, making them mushy and unappetizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some cool season crops such as beets, carrots, lettuce, and potatoes will stand a light frost even without covering. They can be harvested after frost. Some root crops can stay in the ground and be harvested throughout the winter.&nbsp; This only works in areas that are consistently cold. Otherwise, the root crops will rot in the ground with repeated freeze thaw cycles.&nbsp; &nbsp; Other cool season crops, like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi, will tolerate even a light freeze. These crops can actively grow in cooler temperatures and handle several frosts before the plant starts to have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How Do I Protect My Garden?</strong></p>

<p> In my opinion mulching is the best way to protect your garden.  Mulching is a good way to protect very small gardens.  Use several layers of newspaper, straw or chopped corn stalks.  For those with large gardens, it may be more practical to protect only a few plants of each crop.  Blankets, tarps, floating row covers, or other large materials can be placed over rows of vegetables for protection.  There are a lot of products on the market that can help you extend your gardening season. Most are very effective. Cloches, paper tents, hot caps, and plastic walls of water are the more effective but expensive ways for frost protection.  All frost protection takes more time and effort on your part.  You can cause more damage if these are left on when the days are warm, but the nights are cold.  In cases of light frost, sometimes only the upper and outer foliage are damaged. The plants can still continue production.  </p>



<p>If plant covering is not feasible, pick as much produce as possible if frost is predicted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Most crops will not ripen any further once picked, but tomatoes are an exception. Mature green tomatoes can be ripened to full color indoors.&nbsp; Light is not necessary to ripen tomatoes.&nbsp; In fact, ripening of tomatoes is mostly affected by temperature.&nbsp; The warmer the temperature, the faster the ripening. Extensive warmth will over ripen your tomatoes before you get a chance to eat them. &nbsp; To store tomatoes for later use, wrap the fruit individually in newspaper and store at 55 degrees F. &nbsp; Make sure the tomatoes have no blemishes or soft spots.&nbsp; The fruits will gradually ripen in several weeks. This can give you garden fresh tomatoes well into the late fall, early winter.&nbsp; Some varieties of tomatoes store better then others varieties such as Roma or San Marzano. I once had a client that was so good at storing tomatoes that they would store them into January. &nbsp; They had a root cellar that had perfect temperatures. They were meticulous about getting rid of tomatoes with blemishes.&nbsp; They would take a few tomatoes out, warm them up and they would ripen. My client loved having fresh tomatoes in January. Many gardeners would envy them for having a fresh tomato during this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use this information to help plan next year&#8217;s garden. Plant fruit and vegetables that can extend your gardening season.&nbsp; Knowing which plants tolerate frost is important. It is also crucial to know which ones aren&#8217;t frost tolerant. This knowledge is key to being able to harvest your garden well into the Autumn.&nbsp; Your tender plants would need the most protection.&nbsp; Planting them so you can install hoops or some other way to easily put frost protection over the plants in the spring will make it much easier in the fall when you are extending your season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Vegetable Tolerance Chart</strong></p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown vegetables and indicates their tolerance to frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)</td><td>Semi-Hardy<br>(Tolerant light frost)<br></td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Beans</td><td>Beets</td><td>Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td>Cucumber</td><td>Carrot</td><td>Brussels sprouts</td></tr><tr><td>Eggplants</td><td>Cauliflower</td><td>Cabbage</td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand Spinach</td><td>Celery</td><td>Collards</td></tr><tr><td>Okra</td><td>Chard</td><td>Kale</td></tr><tr><td>Pepper</td><td>Chinese Cabbage</td><td>Kohlrabi</td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>Endive</td><td>Mustard Greens</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td><td>Lettuce</td><td>Onion</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Corn</td><td>Parsnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet potato</td><td>Potato</td><td>Peas</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato</td><td>Salsify</td><td>Radish</td></tr><tr><td>Watermelon</td><td></td><td>Spinach</td></tr><tr><td>Melons</td><td></td><td>Turnip</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Herb Garden?</strong></p>



<p>Herbs can be more difficult to figure out which ones are frost tolerant and which ones are not. Several herbs are perennial, meaning they die back every year and come back in the spring. &nbsp; Herbs are a little different because they have some different modes of survival.&nbsp; Some Herbs are annuals but will sow their seeds and then come back each year from the seed from the previous year. These are not technically cold hardy plants but their seed survives. Some self sewing in cold temp&nbsp;are cilantro/coriander, dill, borage, calendula,&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="339" data-permalink="https://anythingagriculture.com/2024/10/17/understanding-first-frost-and-its-impact-on-your-garden/frost-garden/" data-orig-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="frost garden" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=750" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-339" style="width:324px;height:auto" srcset="https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=150 150w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anythingagriculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/frost-garden.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another type of herb life cycle that can also come back are Biennials. Biennial plants are plants that come back and complete their life cycle in two seasons.&nbsp; Biennials&nbsp;herbs include angelica, caraway, clary, parsley, watercress. These will die back then come back in the spring to complete there life cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The following chart lists most commonly grown herbs and indicates their tolerance to frost.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Tender<br>(Damaged by light frost)<br></td><td>Semi Hardy<br>(Tolerate light frost)</td><td>Hardy<br>(Tolerate hard frost)</td></tr><tr><td>Basil</td><td>Lavender</td><td>Chives</td></tr><tr><td>Rosemary</td><td>Catnip</td><td>Parsley</td></tr><tr><td>Rue</td><td>Hyssop</td><td>Mint</td></tr><tr><td>St. Johns wort</td><td>Comfrey</td><td>Sorrel</td></tr><tr><td>Valerian</td><td>Feverfew</td><td>Tarragon</td></tr><tr><td>Chamomile</td><td>Lemon Balm</td><td>Thyme</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Lovage</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>What About My Fruits Trees?</strong></p>



<p>Fruit&nbsp; and cold tolerance has many different factors. There are three stages of cold hardiness. One stage,&nbsp; is the plant. Can the plant survive the cold temperature?&nbsp; The second, is  the fruit, can the fruit deal with frost or cold temperature.&nbsp; Third, and perhaps most importantly, what stage is the plant in when the cold temperatures occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the fruit plants, most fruit trees commonly found in the Midwest can handle pretty cold temperatures and survive.&nbsp; In the fall most of the fruit on plants have already been harvested except for apples and some pears.&nbsp; Apples are a special fruit as their fruit can withstand some frosts. &nbsp; Some people may have raspberry plants that has put on a second crop in the fall. These berries are very susceptible to a frost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The plant stage has more to do with surviving frost than anything else.&nbsp; The flowering stage is the most sensitive for all fruiting plants. &nbsp; This is why we hear a lot about spring frosts hurting the fruit crops.&nbsp; Spring frost will kill flower tissue and hurt the plant&#8217;s pollination. So, for most fruit plant spring frost are the most dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Strawberries have other concerns about overwintering. They do best when mulched overwinter to help the crowns survive.&nbsp; Summer producing fruit only has to worry about frosts in the spring.&nbsp; Apricots, most berries, peaches, plums, and nectarines are very susceptible to frost injury in the spring, by the time autumn frost happens these plants have already been harvested.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fall officially arrived in the Midwest! I am totally looking ahead to the cool weather and of course pumpkin spice. What I&#8217;m most excited about more than anything else is fall color. Despite the fact we have had very warm days. We are seeing some signs of Fall. Some fall colors have already started.

<p>Fall officially arrived in the Midwest! I am totally looking ahead to the cool weather and of course pumpkin spice. What I&#8217;m most excited about more than anything else is fall color. Despite the fact we have had very warm days.  We are seeing some signs of Fall. Some fall colors have already started. Black walnuts and their leaves have been raining down. Burning bushes have started to turn a brilliant red. Soon Autumn will be a riot of color. Unfortunately, this year, we may find our colors a little muted since we spent a late summer in drought conditions.</p>



<p>Why do the trees and shrubs change colors?</p>



<p> Trees and shrubs that lose their leaves are starting to ready themselves for winter. The days start getting shorter and the night longer. This change signals the plants to start the process of breaking down the chlorophyll in the leaves. The chlorophyll is what causes the leaves to be green. Without chlorophyll, the plant can no longer produce its own food. The plant is forced to go into storage mode. Storage mode helps the plant store its food to help it through the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old wives tales </p>



<p>There are many factors that contribute to Fall color. There are also old wives tales about fall color.&nbsp; One old wife&#8217;s tail is that dry weather and frost promote the brightest leaf color.&nbsp; This is unfortunately untrue but there are other factors that can give the most spectacular fall color.&nbsp; The three factors are the pigments in the leaf, the length of night and weather. </p>



<p>The best fall colors</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The best fall coloration occurs when we have cool nights in the forties. Warm afternoons in the sixties and seventies also contribute. Adequate rainfall is essential for bright fall colors. The sugars that promote the bright reds and oranges are produced in these weather conditions.&nbsp; The pigment is the leaves that cause the bright colors are carotenoids and anthocyanins. Drought conditions can cause the leaves to become duller than when we have abundant rain.&nbsp; When we have more rain in the fall, the leaves tend to get knocked off the plants. This may shorten the fall color window.&nbsp; Fall leaf color will likely peak in about two weeks in the Midwest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s up with evergreens?</p>

<p>Evergreens are also preparing for winter and losing any needles that aren&#8217;t going to help them through the winter.&nbsp; This phenomenon that happens in the fall is called Needle Drop.&nbsp; Although evergreen don’t lose all their leaves in the fall, they do drop needles that are damaged or necessary. If all of the needles drop off the evergreen, you may have a disease problem that needs to be addressed. Or you may have a Bald Cypress or Larch. These trees lose all their needles every year. &nbsp;So, before you cut down that dead tree make sure it not a just dormant. I had a client once who had a beautiful bald cypress grove. Thinking they were dead trees because they moved to the property in winter. They had planned to cut all the &#8220;dead&#8221; trees down.  Luckily, they had sustained an injury and could not deal with the trees until spring. In spring, they discovered that their dead trees came back to life!</p>



<p>Evergreens have shallow roots and are very sensitive to environmental pressure like soil compaction and moisture.&nbsp; Too wet and the tree can drown, too dry and the tree can wither. Both conditions can lead to needle drop that is not normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why doesn&#8217;t all the leaves look beautiful?</p>



<p>Why are some trees and bushes so bright and other trees don&#8217;t have any color at all? Some trees or shrubs have various fungi and/or diseases on the leaves. If a plant has been battling a fungus or disease issue, it is common for the leaves to drop early. The leaves may also look brown or shriveled. The best course of action is to gather these early dropped leaves. You should compost them or get rid of them off your property. Sometimes diseases will show up at the end of the growing season. There is little reason for concern since the leaves will be dropping soon anyway. Tulip poplar trees in particular have powdery mildew on leaves. These will not hurt the tree and will be going away shortly.</p>



<p>Lumpy bumpy leaves</p>



<p> You may notice on the fallen leaves that there are bumps or growths on the leaves. These are usually no cause for concern. These are usually insects that have laid eggs on the leaf. The leaf has grown a structure around it called a Gall. The insects and the galls are harmless and you are witnessing part of the life cycle of that particular insect. Gall can also be produced if the plant has a particular disease. Most of the time the galls do not affect the health of the plant. They are a neat curiosity to see in the fall. </p>

<p>Why are the veins so green?</p>



<p>Red maples in the landscape can have a condition called interveinal chlorosis. This is where the veins are bright green, and the rest of the leaf is yellow. This commonly happens when they are showing a manganese deficiency due to too high of a soil pH. This condition can be corrected by lowering soil pH. Fall is a great time to soil test. </p>



<p>Fall is the best time to amend you soils for the coming year. Take a look at my article <a href="https://anythingagriculture.com/blog/">Soil is not dirt</a>. for more information.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoy all that fall has to offer. Apple cider, pumpkins, and bonfires await you. Best of all are the fall colors.</p>

Heirloom plants can be defined in many ways, but there are some characteristics that many of the definitions share.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are always open pollinated.&nbsp; This means that the seeds from this year’s plants will grow to be just like that of the parent plant.&nbsp; That true-to-seed characteristic makes Heirloom seeds able to be harvested and saved year after year.&nbsp; Heirloom plants are usually varieties that have been around for a long period of time. Some believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been around for longer than 50 years.&nbsp; This period of time can vary depending on who you talk to.&nbsp; Some people believe that Heirloom plants are those that have been handed down over generations of seed savers; they feel that Heirloom plants are a part of their cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hybrid Advantages</strong></p>



<p>Hybrid plants&nbsp; are developed by taking two different plants and cross pollinating them to try to create a better plant. For example, scientists may take two different tomato plants, one that has big fruit and one that is disease resistant. These two plants are cross- pollinated in hopes that the resulting offspring may be a plant that has big fruit and is also disease resistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Heirloom Advantages</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Heirloom plants is that they are known for excellent flavor, color, or fragrances.&nbsp; Heirloom plants come in a large variety of shapes and sizes which are fun to have in the garden.&nbsp; They have a strong cultural connection for many gardeners.&nbsp; However, Heirloom plants also have some disadvantages. They can be less hardy or disease resistant.&nbsp; Some seeds may take a longer time to germinate. The germination rates for Heirloom seeds may be low or erratic. &nbsp; The growth habit of Heirloom seeds can seem wild or unruly. &nbsp; Heirloom plants may not produce as many fruits or flowers as hybridized plants. They can also have traits that are undesirable such as thorns or ugly fruit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantage of Hybrid plants is that they are very dependable for producing flowers or fruits. &nbsp; They tend to produce more fruits or flowers.&nbsp; They generally have better and faster germination rates than Heirloom plants. Some Hybrid vegetables will produce all at once so it is easier to predict when the crop is ready to be harvested. Hybrid plants also have a more predictable growth habit.&nbsp; One of the big disadvantages of Hybrid plants is that sometimes one trait is sacrificed for another, for example, flavor is sacrificed for disease resistance.&nbsp; Also, if you find a plant that you really like you will have to buy new seeds year after year.&nbsp; Hybrid plants may also cost more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most gardeners raise a combination of Heirloom and Hybrid plants, desiring traits from both types. Because there are so many exceptional varieties of both Heirloom and Hybrid plants it is worth experimenting with growing both types to decide what works best for you.&nbsp; Part of the fun is looking around at all the beautiful tomatoes that are in the garden right now and determining which one you would like to grow next year.&nbsp; Make sure you take notes in your garden journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been growing for Tomatoes for year and I like to plant a variety of tomatoes. I love to grow Heirlooms for eating fresh and love to grow hybrids for cooking and canning. Let me know what your preference. </p>
